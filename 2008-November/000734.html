<PRE>Hi Bruce and Pat (and anyone in the WSJT Developer's group...),

WSPR users have been moving from 30 m to other bands much 
more frequently recently.  This is a good development.

Over the weekend I added a few features to WSPR to make 
band-switching more convenient.  Before I make a public 
release of WSPR v1.1, would you be willing to try it for a 
few days and let me know if you have any additional 
suggestions?

You can download the Windows installation file from

<A HREF="http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR110.EXE">http://physics.princeton.edu/pulsar/K1JT/WSPR110.EXE</A>

As always, you can also compile the program from code at the 
head of the SVN repository.

The new features are these:

1. There is now a Band menu.  Selecting a band sets the Dial 
frequency entry to the QRG listed at the bottom of the 
WSPRnet home page.

2. Dial frequency and Tx frequency are now &quot;remembered&quot; 
independently for each band.

3. Tx frequency is indicated with a red tick on the 
waterfall's frequency scale.

4. Incorrect entries for Tx frequency (entries that would 
require an audio tone outside the range 1400-1600 Hz) now 
generate a warning message.

5. Tx duty cycle of 10% has been added.

6. The &quot;Basic Operating Instructions&quot; displayed by F1 have 
been updated.

7. A couple of very minor bugs were fixed.

After running WSPR 1.1 for a couple of days, please let me 
know if you find any problems ... or have suggestions for 
additional improvements!

	-- 73, Joe, K1JT
