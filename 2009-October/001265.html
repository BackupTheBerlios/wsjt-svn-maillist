 ISCAT has similar design goals to JT6M, but achieves them much more
 effectively.  As in JTMS, messages are source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78
-bits.  FEC redundancy is added using the Reed Solomon codes (63,5),
-(63,8), and (63,13), with 6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing information is
-appended as a sequence of eight tones forming an 8x8 &quot;Costas array&quot;.
-Different Costas arrays are used to denote 30-bit, 48-bit, and 78-bit
-messages.  Modulation is 64-FSK keyed at 23.4 baud, so the total
-bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are repeated 9 times in a
-27.3 s transmission.  Under conditions of additive white gaussian
-noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading, ISCAT signals are decodable on
-signal enhancements lasting a few seconds at S/N = -15 to -18 dB, and

 JT64 builds on the best features of JT65 and adds further enhancements
 for better performance.  In place of 72-bit messages it offers 30, 48,

-Arbitrary add-on prefixes are allowed, rather than prefixes selected
