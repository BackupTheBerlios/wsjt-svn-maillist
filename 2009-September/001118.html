 EME on VHF and UHF bands

-JT65 was designed for EME on the VHF bands, and has proven to be
-effective on UHF bands as well.  Messages are source-encoded to 72
-bits and carry Reed-Solomon error control using a (63,12) code and
-6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing information is sent as a pseudo-random
-pattern of 1266 ON/OFF intervals of a single tone.  Encoded data is
-sent using 64-MSK modulation during the 63 &quot;sync OFF&quot; intervals.  The
-keying rate is 2.69 baud, so a full transmission takes 126/2.69 = 46.8
-s.  Total bandwidth is 178 Hz (JT65A), 355 Hz (JT65B), and 711 Hz
-(JT65C).  Decoding is done using the Koetter-Vardy algebraic
-soft-decision algorithm.  Arbitrary JT65B messages can be reliably
-copied down to S/N = -24 dB.  The &quot;Deep Search&quot; decoder can copy
-messages involving callsigns found in a local database down to -28 dB.
-Shorthand codes are available to convey the simple messages &quot;RO&quot;,
