 Ionospheric Scatter on 6m
 -------------------------
 
-JT6M takes advantage of the mixture of ionospheric scatter and meteor
-scatter typically seen at distances 800-2000 km on 50 MHz.  As in
-FSK441, user messages are sent character by character, with no further
-encoding.  Modulation is continuous-phase 44-FSK at 21.5 baud.  Each
-tone represents a distinct character from an &quot;alphabet&quot; of 43
-characters, or a synchronizing tone; the sync tone is sent in 1
-of every 3 symbol intervals.  No start-of-message synchronizing is
-provided.  The character transmission rate is 14.4 cps.  Messages can
-sometimes be decoded at signal levels as low as S/N = -10 dB (in a
-2500 Hz reference noise bandwidth).

 IScat has similar design goals to JT6M.  As in JTMS, messages are
 source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78 bits.  FEC redundancy is added using
 one of the Reed Solomon codes (63,5), (63,8), or (63,13), with 6-bit
 symbols.  Synchronizing information is appended as a sequence of eight
 tones forming an 8x8 &quot;Costas array&quot;.  Different Costas arrays are used
-to denote 30-bit, 48-bit, or 78-bit messages.  Modulation is 64-FSK at
-23.4 baud, so the total bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are
-repeated 9 times in each 27.3 s transmission.  Under conditions of
-AWGN and Rayleigh fading, IScat signals are decodable on brief signal
-enhancements at S/N = -15 dB, and with average S/N as low as -21 dB.
