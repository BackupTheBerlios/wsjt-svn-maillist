+
+Meteor Scatter
+--------------
+
+FSK441 was designed for meteor scatter, especially on 2m.  User
+messages are sent character by character, with no other encoding.
+Modulation is 4-FSK keyed at 441 baud.  With adequate S/N (minimum
+ping strength (S+N)/N around 2 dB) the protocol is self synchronizing.
+The character transmission rate is 147 cps, so copying the message
+&quot;WA1ABC 26 KC0XYZ 2626 &quot; requires a ping duration 150 ms.
+
+JTMS has the same basic design goals as FSK441.  User messages are
+&quot;source encoded&quot; to packets of n=30, 48, or 78 bits using lossless
+compression.  Forward error correction (FEC) is added to the using a
+K=13, r=1/2 convolutional code, and a 32-bit synchronizing vector is
+appended.  The number of transmitted symbols in a message is thus
+2*(n+K-1)+32.  Modulation is MSK (&quot;minimum shift keying&quot;) at 1500
+baud, so the raw data rate is 1500 bps and the bandwidth 2250 Hz.  The
+78-bit user message &quot;WA1ABC KC0XYZ R26&quot; requires 212 channel symbols
+and is transmitted in 141 ms.  The 48-bit message &quot;CQ KC0XYZ EM48&quot;
+takes 101 ms, and the 30-bit message &quot;CQ KC0XYZ&quot; takes only 77 ms.
+The 32-bit sync vector makes start-of-message recognition very secure,
+and the strong FEC means that messages are usually copied exactly, or
+not at all.  Sensitivity is about the same as FSK441, but shorter
+pings can be used more effectively and on-screen decoding &quot;garbage&quot;
+will be much less than with FSK441.
+
+
+Ionospheric Scatter on 6m
+-------------------------
+
+JT6M takes advantage of the mixture of ionospheric scatter and meteor
+scatter typically seen at distances 800-2000 km on 50 MHz.  As in
+FSK441, user messages are sent character by character, with no further
+encoding.  Modulation is continuous-phase 44-FSK at 21.5 baud.  Each
+tone represents a distinct character from an &quot;alphabet&quot; of 43
+characters, or a synchronizing tone; the sync tone is sent in 1
+of every 3 symbol intervals.  No start-of-message synchronizing is
+provided.  The character transmission rate is 14.4 cps.  Messages can
+sometimes be decoded at signal levels as low as S/N = -10 dB (in a
+2500 Hz reference noise bandwidth).
+
+IScat has similar design goals to JT6M.  As in JTMS, messages are
+source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78 bits.  FEC redundancy is added using
+one of the Reed Solomon codes (63,5), (63,8), or (63,13), with 6-bit
+symbols.  Synchronizing information is appended as a sequence of eight
+tones forming an 8x8 &quot;Costas array&quot;.  Different Costas arrays are used
+to denote 30-bit, 48-bit, or 78-bit messages.  Modulation is 64-FSK at
+23.4 baud, so the total bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are
+repeated 9 times in each 27.3 s transmission.  Under conditions of
+AWGN and Rayleigh fading, IScat signals are decodable on brief signal
+enhancements at S/N = -15 dB, and with average S/N as low as -21 dB.
+Decoding is much more reliable than with JT6M, and on-screen decoding
+&quot;garbage&quot; is much less.
+
+
+
+EME on VHF and UHF bands
+------------------------
+
+JT65 was designed for EME on the VHF bands, and has proven to be
+effective on UHF bands as well.  Messages are source-encoded to 72
+bits and carry Reed-Solomon error-control coding using a (63,12) code
+and 6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing information is sent as a
+pseudo-random pattern of 63 ON and 63 OFF intervals of a single tone.
+Encoded data is sent using 64-MSK modulation, sent during the 63
+sync-OFF intervals.  The keying rate is 2.69 baud, so a full
+transmission takes 126/2.69 = 46.8 s.  Total bandwidth is 178 Hz
+(JT65A), 355 Hz (JT65B), and 711 Hz (JT65C).  Decoding is done using
+the Koetter-Vardy algebraic soft-decision algorithm.  Arbitrary JT65
+messages can be reliably copied down to S/N = -24 dB.  The &quot;Deep
+Search&quot; decoder copies messages involving callsigns found in a
+local database down to -28 dB.  Shorthand codes are available to
+convey the simple messages &quot;RO&quot;, &quot;RRR&quot;, and &quot;73&quot;, and these can be
+copied down to -30 dB or below.
+
+JT64 captures the best features of JT65 and adds further enhancements
+and better performance.  In place of 72-bit messages it offers 30, 48,
+and 78-bit messages (as well as shorthands like those of JT655).  Only
+28% of transmitted energy is devoted to message synchronization,
+compared with 50% in JT65, yet sync performance is at least as good as
+JT65.  Arbitrary add-on prefixes are allowed, rather than prefixes
+chosen from a restricted list.  The 78-bit messages can be copied down
+to about -26 dB, and 30-bit messages down to -29 dB.
