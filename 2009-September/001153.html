 JT6M was designed to take advantage of the mixture of ionospheric
-scatter and meteor scatter that is typically seen at distances
-800-2000 km on 50 MHz.  As in FSK441, user messages are sent character
-by character, with no further encoding.  Modulation is
-continuous-phase 44-FSK at 21.5 baud.  Each tone represents a distinct
-character from an &quot;alphabet&quot; of 43 characters, or else a synchronizing
-tone; the sync tone is sent in every 3rd symbol interval. The
-character transmission rate is 14.4 cps, and no start-of-message
-synchronizing is provided.  Messages can be decoded at signal levels

 ISCAT has similar design goals to JT6M, but achieves them much more
 effectively.  As in JTMS, messages are source-encoded to 30, 48, or 78
-bits.  FEC redundancy is added using one of the Reed Solomon codes
-(63,5), (63,8), or (63,13), with 6-bit symbols.  Synchronizing
-information is appended as a sequence of eight tones forming an 8x8
-&quot;Costas array&quot;.  Different Costas arrays are used to denote 30-bit,
-48-bit, and 78-bit messages.  Modulation is 64-FSK and keyed at 23.4
-baud, so the total bandwidth is 64*23.4 = 1500 Hz.  Messages are
-repeated 9 times in a 27.3 s transmission.  Under conditions of
-additive white gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading, ISCAT
-signals are decodable on brief signal enhancements at S/N = -10 dB,
-and with weaker signals that may average as little as -18 dB.
