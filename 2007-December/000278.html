<!--beginarticle-->
<PRE>After some weeks (or has it been months?) of tinkering I have managed  
to compile WSJT on Mac OS X 10.4 yielding a functional executable.

I am currently running WSJT 5.9.8 R575 (Only because that is the last  
CO I did via SVN) on a Power PC Based Mac (Dual 2GHz G5/2.5GB RAM)  
and it seems to work quite well with all JT65 modes as well as JT2  
and JT4 modes.  I have not tried any other modes, but it seems likely  
the other modes should work as well.  While this is all good news for  
anyone wanting to run WSJT on Mac OS issues remain that will need  
some attention before it will be usable in general, mainly with the  
UI.  At this time there are both visual and functional issues with  
the UI under Mac OS.. functionally the worst failure I have seen is  
double right clicking a callsign does not work to generate sequences,  
but I am guessing that will be something I can trace and fix.   
Visually the UI will need some adjustment to render correctly with  
Mac OS X but it works, for the most part.  So, WSJT on Mac OS X is  
not a lost cause as it had seemed to be.

Here is what it took to get it working on my setup.

Install Mac OS X Developer Tools (Xcode)

	I am using XCode v2.5 but 2.4 should work as well.  Apple has  
released v3 with OS X 10.5, I am not running 10.5 here and probably  
will not upgrade any time soon as it will break another unrelated  
software package I use.  From what I can determine the packages below  
should work with 10.5/Developer Tool chain v3 as well.

The following is explained in more detail at <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</A> 
Installing_SciPy/Mac_OS_X and is worth looking at as it presents a  
method to get python/fortran/numpy/scipy running on OS X with up to  
date versions and better results than other methods I have seen/ 
attempted.

Install Python 2.5.1 from www.python.org ( <A HREF="http://www.python.org/ftp/">http://www.python.org/ftp/</A> 
python/2.5.1/python-2.5.1-macosx.dmg )

	While Python installs with OS X it is an older version and I found  
that many of the issues I had with getting WSJT up disappeared when I  
moved to the newer version.

Install GFortran from <A HREF="http://r.research.att.com/tools/">http://r.research.att.com/tools/</A> ( <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
r.research.att.com/gfortran-4.2.1.dmg )

	This seems to be the one Mac OS X implementation of GFortran that  
works properly.  I have tried, at least, 3 other implementations and  
none worked as well as this one.  This implementation is fully  
universal, i.e. it will generate i386, PPC, x86_64 and PPC64 bit code.

At this point it is CRUCIAL that you check your shell's path  
setting.  What matters is that /usr/bin is BEFORE /usr/local/bin or  
any other location (such as /sw/bin where fink places binaries or / 
optlocal/bin where macports places binaries).  We need to see gcc, ld  
and others from the default OS X tool chain and only use gfortran as  
installed in /usr/local/bin.

Install FFTW Library from <A HREF="http://fftw.org">http://fftw.org</A> ( <A HREF="http://fftw.org/">http://fftw.org/</A> 
fftw-3.1.2.tar.gz )

	FFTW can be installed with some of the package tools (Fink and  
Macports) but building it from source and installing as outlined on  
the Installing SciPY/Mac OS X page yields a working configuration  
while the packaged installation methods does not.

Install Numpy from <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/Download">http://www.scipy.org/Download</A> ( <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
downloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/numpy-1.0.4.tar.gz?use_mirror=internap )

	See the instructions for installation at <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</A> 
Installing_SciPy/Mac_OS_X

Install SciPY from <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/Download">http://www.scipy.org/Download</A> ( <A HREF="http://">http://</A> 
prdownloads.sourceforge.net/scipy/scipy-0.6.0.tar.gz?download )

	Again, see the instructions from <A HREF="http://www.scipy.org/">http://www.scipy.org/</A> 
Installing_SciPyMac_OS_X (especially for SciPY as you need to use  
some additional commands beyond python setup.py install )

Install Numpy <A HREF="http://downloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/">http://downloads.sourceforge.net/numpy/</A> 
numpy-1.0.4.tar.gz?modtime=1194536674&amp;big_mirror=0

	Use python setup.py build .. sudo python setup.py install

Instal python-imaging from <A HREF="http://effbot.org/media/downloads/">http://effbot.org/media/downloads/</A> 
Imaging-1.1.6.tar.gz

	Use python setup.py build .. sudo python setup.py install [Note: You  
will need to install libjpeg if you think you will need PIL with jpeg  
support, I did not bother with that on my setup and it seems to work  
fine with WSJT)
	
Install libsamplerate from <A HREF="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html">http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/download.html</A>  
( <A HREF="http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/libsamplerate-0.1.2.tar.gz">http://www.mega-nerd.com/SRC/libsamplerate-0.1.2.tar.gz</A> )

	Use ./configure .. make .. sudo make install

Install reed-solomon-4.0 from <A HREF="http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/reed-">http://www.ka9q.net/code/fec/reed-</A> 
solomon-4.0.tar.gz

	The makfile generated from ./configure is not &quot;OS X Aware&quot; and needs  
some changes to work properly.  You may download the makefile I  
edited at <A HREF="http://jt65.w6cqz.org/down/rs4makefile.darwin">http://jt65.w6cqz.org/down/rs4makefile.darwin</A> then use sudo  
make -f rs4makefile.darwin install (Actually.. is this really  
necessary? It seems the RS code is in the source tree and I see no  
sign of linking to librs so maybe that is old info in the SuSE build  
instructions, but better safe than sorry).

Install portaudio.

	Portaudio is the item that causes the most grief in getting WSJT  
working on OS X.  While all the other items work with OS X more or  
less as the instructions for compiling WSJT with SuSE Linux indicate  
it is portaudio that needs to be handled differently.  First, static  
linking portaudio from the in tree version of WSJT simply does not  
work.  For the static linkage to work you need to pull in several  
dynamic libraries to support libportaudio.a and it is more trouble  
than it is worth to make that happen as those libraries are framework  
libs in Mac OS X and no combination of flags passed to f2py and/or  
gfortran worked to add those framework libraries to the linkage.   
Rather than continue to pull my hair out trying to make that work I  
decided to drop the static linkage of portaudio and change to a  
dynamic linkage.  It was at that point that WSJT compiled and worked  
on OS X (almost) effortlessly.  I'm using the latest snapshot version  
here but the standard release also seems to work, but the snapshot  
versions apparently have some bug fixes for OS X so I will reference  
that release.  So.. back to install portaudio.

Download portaudio at <A HREF="http://www.portaudio.com/archives/">http://www.portaudio.com/archives/</A> 
pa_snapshot_v19.tar.gz

	Extract then run ./configure .. make  .. sudo make install

That leaves WSJT..

	I am using r575 here as it is what I had last checked out from SVN.   
Assuming nothing has changed too radically since the later SVN  
versions should work as well (Actually I have compiled R385 and R540  
as well since I had those on hand and both worked fine). So..

	from WSJT source directory run ./configure
	edit Makefile as follows;

	LIBS = -lpthread   -lsamplerate portaudio-v19/lib/.libs/libportaudio.a
	change to
	LIBS = -lpthread -lsamplerate -lportaudio

	CPPFLAGS = -Iportaudio-v19/include -I/usr/local/include
	change to
	CPPFLAGS = -I/usr/local/include

	Comment out the portaudio lines so you do not waste time building  
something that has already been built ;)

	portaudio-v19/lib/.libs/libportaudio.a:
         #	(cd portaudio-v19;./configure --with-pic --with-jack=no)
         #	(cd portaudio-v19;${MAKE})

	portaudio_clean:
         #	(cd portaudio-v19;${MAKE} clean)

	run make

	If all went as hoped for you should be able to use the command  
python ./wsjt.py

I hope this will be of some help to those who crave WSJT for the  
Macintosh.  There is still much to be done before it will be of  
general use, but it least it is possible to compile a working version  
that receives and transmits correctly.  Now that I have gotten this  
far I hope I will be able to track down the UI issues mentioned  
before and clean those up.  Also for anyone considering taking on  
WSJT + Mac OS X please note that I have no idea how many things are  
broken as I have only had a couple of hours runtime with it.  I have  
seen some strange results in decoding JT2, and in the &quot;Moon&quot; panel  
the value for Dgrd is incorrect so there are certainly issues to be  
tackled, but at least there is enough working correctly that one can  
begin to fix that which is not. :)
