Log:
Split the asciidoc source for WSJT-X User's Guide into many
smaller files, by section and sub-section.  

Also extensive editing up through section 7.  Sections 6.2, 8, and
beyond definitely need work.  Other polishing is also desirable, and
maybe also some additions and/or changes.

+- Many users of WSJT, too numerous to mention here individually, have
+contributed suggestions and advice that have greatly aided the
+development of {wsjtx} and its sister programs.  Since 2005 the
+overall project (including WSJT, MAP65, WSPR, {wsjtx}, and WSPR-X) has
+been &#8220;open source&#8221;, all code being licensed under the GNU Public
+License (GPL).
+
+- For {wsjtx} in particular, I wish to acknowledge contributions from:
+*AC6SL, AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KK1D, PY2SDR,
+VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, and W4TV*.
+
+- Each has helped to bring the program&#8217;s design, code, and
+documentation to its present state. Most of the color palettes for the
+{wsjtx} waterfall were shamelessly copied from the excellent, well
+documented, open-source program fldigi, by W1HKJ and friends.

+
+- With marginal or unrecognizable signals the sequential {shannonfano}
+can take exponentially long times to completion.
+
+- If the first step in the above sequence finds many seemingly worthy
+candidate signals, and if many of them turn out to be undecodable, the
+decoding loop could take a very long time.
+
+- For this reason the decode9 step is programmed to &#8220;time out&#8221; and
+report failure if it takes too long.
+
+- The choice Fast | Normal | Deepest on the Decode menu provides a
+three-step control of this timeout limit.

+- {wsjtx} acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a
+12000 Hz rate.  Spectra from overlapping data segments are computed
+for the waterfall display and saved at intervals of half the JT9
+symbol length.
+
+- As shown in screen shots earlier in this Guide, a *JT9* signal
+appears in the Cumulative spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about
+16 Hz wide.  Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the
+one in *JT65*, by convention the nominal frequency of a *JT9* signal
+is nevertheless taken to be that of the lowest tone at the left edge
+of the spectrum.
+
+- At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
+minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
+operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
+twice:
+
+* first over a narrow range around the selected Rx frequency
+
+* Then in the full displayed frequency range (or in *JT9+JT65* mode, the
+displayed range above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).
+
+- Decoding of clean *JT9* signals in a white-noise background starts
+to fail around signal-to-noise ratio &#8211;25 dB and reached the 50% level
+at -26 dB
+
+- Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.

+//Needs work!
+.The JT9 Protocol and its Implementation
+
+- *JT9* is a mode designed for making QSOs at HF, MF, and LF.  The
+mode uses essentially the same 72-bit structured messages as *JT65*.
+
+- Error control coding (ECC) uses a strong convolutional code with
+constraint length K=32, rate r=1/2, and a zero tail.  WIth 72-bit
+user messages, this leads to an encoded message length of 
+(72+31) &#215; 2 = 206 bits.
+
+- Modulation is 9-FSK: 8 tone frequencies for data, and one for
+synchronization.  In a given transmission sixteen tone intervals
+(those numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 16, 23, 33, 35, 51, 52, 55, 60, 66, 73,
+83, and 85 in the sequence) are devoted to synchronization.  Thus, a
+transmission requires a total of (206 / 3) + 16 = 85 (rounded up) tone
+intervals.
+
+- Symbol lengths are chosen so that nsps, the number of samples
+per symbol (at 12000 samples per second) is a number with no prime
+factor greater than 7.  This choice makes for efficient FFTs. Tone
+spacing of the 9-FSK modulation is:
+
+-----  
+df = 1 / tsym = 12000 / nsps, equal to the keying rate
+-----
+
+- Symbol durations are approximately (TRperiod - 8) / 85, where
+TRperiod is the T/R sequence length in seconds.
+
+
+- The total occupied bandwidth is 9 &#215; df. The generated signal has
+continuous phase and constant amplitude, so there are no key
+clicks. For experimental purposes, submodes of *JT9* were defined with
+transmission lengths greater than one minute.
+
+- Parameters of all submodes are summarized in the following table,
+along with approximate decoding thresholds measured by simulation on
+an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Numbers following
+*``JT9-''* in the submode names specify the T/R sequence length in
+minutes.  When not otherwise specified in this Guide, *JT9* implies
+submode *JT9-1*, the only submode implemented in current versions of
+{wsjtx}.

+easier. This is a work-in-progress. Some rigs may never be covered,
+but we should try to cover many as possible.

+- *Call Sign*: &lt;Your Call Sign&gt;
+- *Grid*: &lt;Your Maidenhead Locator&gt;
+- *PTT method*: choose from RTS, DTR, CAT, VOX, or None.
+- *PTT port*: if you will use RTS or DTR, choose a serial port,
+- *PSK Reporter*: check to enable sending reception reports to the
+{pskreporter} mapping facility.
+- *CW ID*: Check to send your callsign in CW after sending 73.
+- *CW Interval*: set the time interval for sending your CW identification. 
+Default is 0 (never).
+
+{wsjtx} does not implement full transceiver control, but it provides a
+way to ensure that {wsjtx} can read and set the radio&#8217;s dial
+frequency. If you want this capability:
+
+- Check the box Enable CAT
+- Select your radio type from a drop-down list
+- Select a CAT port (not the same port selected for PTT control)
+- Set port parameters for your radio
+- If you use {dxlcommander} by DX Lab or {hrd} to control your
+transceiver, you can configure {wsjtx} to communicate with the radio
+through that program.  Entries for these programs appear at the end of
+the drop-down list of supported radios.
+
+[[X11]]
+image::images/r3563-config-screen-80.png[align=&quot;center&quot;,alt=&quot;Configuration Screen&quot;]
+
+For now you should leave *Split Tx* unchecked. If you are using CAT
+control, most radios will allow you to set *PTT method* = CAT.  Some
+radios support two types of PTT assertion via CAT control: one takes
+audio input from the Mic connector, the other from a rear-panel Data
+connector.  The simplest CAT configuration sets *Polling interval* = 0
+(no polling the radio for dial frequency).  {wsjtx} will then be able
+to set the radio&#8217;s frequency, but the program will be unaware of
+subsequent changes made using the radio&#8217;s panel controls.
+
+TIP: If you need an additional item in the list of devices for the
+CAT port, edit the configuration file wsjtx.ini and add your
+requirement as CATdriver=yourdriver (for example, 
+CATdriver=/dev/ttyUSBserial ) in the group of entries marked
+[Common].
+
+With most radios you can set *Polling interval* to a small number (say
+1 &#8211; 3 s) and the program will follow any frequency changes made at the
+radio.  Note that you may not be able simultaneously to control your
+radio from {wsjtx} and from another program.  Some experimentation may
+be required, and you may need to refer to the documentation for your
+rig-control software and your radio.  It is best to have the radio and
+any interface equipment turned on and connected before starting
+{wsjtx}, and to exit the program before turning your equipment off.
+
+- Click the *Test CAT Control* and Test PTT buttons to see that you
+have established the desired control of station functions.  _ Select
+the devices you will use for Audio input and output.
+- Click OK to dismiss the Configuration window.
+
+- {wsjtx} expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.
+To ensure that this will be so when running under recent versions of
+Windows, open the system's Sound control panel and select in turn the
+&#8220;Recording&#8221; and &#8220;Playback&#8221; options.  Click on Properties, then
+Advanced, and select &#8220;16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).&#8221;
+
+CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the default device
+for Windows sounds, be sure to turn off all such sounds so they are
+not transmitted over the air.

+- To gain some feeling for the controls you will use when making QSOs, try 
+clicking with the mouse on the decoded text lines and on the waterfall spectral 
+display. You should be able to confirm the following behavior:
+
+- Double-click on either of the decoded lines highlighted in green. This action
+should produce the following:
+
+** Copies call-sign and locater of a station calling CQ to the &#8220;DX Call&#8221; 
+and &#8220;DX grid&#8221; entry fields.
+
+** Generates suitable messages for a minimal QSO and checks or clears the Tx
+even box so that you will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.
+
+** Rx and Tx frequency markers will be moved to the CQ-ing station&#8217;s frequency,
+and the Gen Msg (&#8220;generated message&#8221;) radio button at bottom right of the main
+window will be selected.
+
+** If you had checked &#8220;Double-click on call sets Tx Enable&#8221; on the Setup menu,
+Enable Tx would also be activated, and you would start to transmit automatically,
+at the appropriate time.
+
+- Double-click on the decoded line with the message &#8220;K1JT N5KDV EM41&#8221;, 
+highlighted in [red]*RED*.
+
+- Results will be similar to (a), except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is
+not moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from a 
+tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it was.
+
+- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
+(or checking Lock Tx=Rx) you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.
+
+- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
+sending &#8220;73&#8221; to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
+want to send 73 to him, so the message &#8220;KF4RWA K1JT 73&#8221; is automatically 
+generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
+choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)
+
+- Clicking on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker) to the 
+selected frequency.
+
+- Ctrl-click on waterfall moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.
+
+- Double-click on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency and causes a 
+narrow-band decode there at the new QSO frequency. Decoded text appears in the 
+right window only.  Ctrl-double-click moves both Rx and Tx frequencies and 
+decodes at the new frequency. 
+
+- Clicking Erase clears the right window. Double-click on Erase to clear both 
+text windows.

+{wsjtx} is a computer program designed to facilitate basic amateur
+radio communication using very weak signals.  The first four letters
+in the program name stand for &#8220;Weak Signal communication by K1JT&#8221;, and
+the &#8220;-X&#8221; suffix indicates that {wsjtx} started as an extended (and
+experimental) branch of program WSJT.
+
+{wsjtx} offers two protocols or &#8220;modes,&#8221; JT9 and JT65.  Both are
+designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme weak-signal
+conditions. They use nearly identical message structure and source
+encoding.  JT65 was designed for EME (&#8220;moon-bounce&#8221;) on the VHF/UHF
+bands and has also proved very effective for worldwide QRP
+communication at HF.  JT9 is optimized for the LF, MF, and HF bands.
+It is about 2 dB more sensitive than JT65 while using less than 10% of
+the bandwidth.  Both modes use one-minute timed sequences of
+alternating transmission and reception, so a minimal QSO takes four to
+six minutes &#8212; two or three transmissions by each station, one sending
+in odd UTC minutes and the other even.  World-wide QSOs are possible
+with power levels of a few watts and compromise antennas.
+
+Starting with version 1.1, {wsjtx} can display a bandpass as large as
+5 kHz and provide dual-mode reception of both JT65 and JT9 signals.
+If your receiver can be configured with at least 4 kHz bandwidth in
+USB mode, you can set your dial frequency to one of the standard JT65
+frequencies &#8212; for example, 14.076 MHz for 20 meters &#8212; and have the
+full JT65 and JT9 sub-bands displayed simultaneously on the waterfall.
+You can make QSOs in both modes using nothing more than mouse clicks.
+
+Plans for future program development call for {wsjtx} and WSJT to
+merge together: {wsjtx} will gradually acquire the additional modes
+JT4, FSK441, and ISCAT that are now supported in WSJT.  The entire
+WSJT-related effort is an open-source project.  If you have
+programming or documentation skills or would like to contribute to the
+project in other ways, please make your interests known to the
+development team.  The project&#8217;s source-code repository can be found
+at {devsvn}, and communication among the developers takes place on the
+email reflector {devmail}.

+- *JT65* is a mature mode described in the literature some years
+ago. Details of the *JT9* protocol are presented in &lt;&lt;X16,Appendix A&gt;&gt;
+of this Guide.
+
+- To users already familiar with *JT65*, the most striking difference
+between the two modes is the much smaller occupied bandwidth of JT9:
+15.6 Hz, compared with 177.6 Hz for *JT65A*. Transmissions in the two
+modes are essentially the same length, and both modes use exactly 72
+bits to carry message information.  At the user level the two modes
+support the same message structures.
+
+- *JT65* signal reports are constrained to the range &#8211;1 to &#8211;30 dB &#8212;
+more than adequate for EME purposes, but not enough dynamic range for
+ideal use at HF and below.
+
+- S/N values displayed by the *JT65* decoder are clamped at &#8211;1 dB,
+because that&#8217;s all the original protocol can handle; the S/N scale in
+present *JT65* decoders becomes increasingly nonlinear above &#8211;10 dB.
+
+- By comparison, *JT9* allows for signal reports in the range &#8211;50 to
+\+49 dB.  It manages this by co-opting a small amount of message space
+otherwise used for grid locator's within 1 degree of the south
+pole. The S/N scale of the present *JT9* decoder is reasonably linear,
+although it&#8217;s not intended as a precision measurement tool. With clean
+signals in a clean nose background, *JT65* achieves nearly 100%
+probability of correct decoding down to S/N = &#8211;22 dB and 50% at &#8211;24
+dB.  *JT9* is about 2 dB better, achieving 50% decoding at about &#8211;26
+dB.  Both modes produce extremely low false-decode rates.
+
+- Early experience suggests that under most HF propagation conditions
+the two modes have comparable reliability, with perhaps a slight edge
+to *JT9*. The tone spacing of *JT9* is about two-thirds that of
+*JT65*, so in some disturbed ionospheric conditions in the higher
+portion of the HF spectrum, *JT65* may do better. *JT9* is an order of
+magnitude better in spectral efficiency. On a busy HF band, we often
+find the 2-kHz-wide *JT65* sub-band filled wall-to-wall with signals.
+Ten times as many JT9 signals could fit into the same space, without
+overlap.

+// Status=review
+=== Standard Exchange
+By longstanding tradition, a minimal valid QSO requires the exchange
+of callsigns, a signal report or some other information, and
+acknowledgments.  {wsjtx} is designed to facilitate making such
+minimal QSOs using short, formatted messages.  The process works best
+if you use these formats and follow standard operating practices.  The
+recommended basic QSO goes something like this:
+
+[width=&quot;90%&quot;,cols=&quot;3,^3,^3,^4,10&quot;,options=&quot;header&quot;]
+|=======================================
+|UTC|To|From|Grid/Rpt|Comment
+|0001|CQ|K1ABC|FN42|~ K1ABC calls CQ
+|0002|K1ABC|G0XYZ|IO91|~ G0XYZ answers
+|0003|G0XYZ|K1ABC|&#8211;19|~ K1ABC sends report
+|0004|K1ABC|G0XYZ|R&#8211;22|~ G0XYZ sends acknowledgment and report
+|0005|G0XYZ|K1ABC|RRR|~ K1ABC sends acknowledgment
+|0006|K1ABC|G0XYZ|73|~ G0XYZ sends 73
+|=======================================
+
+*Standard messages* consist of two callsigns (or CQ, QRZ, or DE and
+one callsign) followed by the transmitting station&#8217;s grid locator, a
+signal report, acknowledgement R plus a signal report, or the final
+acknowledgements &#8220;RRR&#8221; or &#8220;73&#8221;.  Messages are compressed and encoded
+in a highly efficient and reliable way.  
+
+*Signal reports* are specified as signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in dB,
+using a standard reference noise bandwidth 2500 Hz.  JT65 reports must
+lie in the range &#8211;30 to &#8211;1 dB, while JT9 supports the extended range
+&#8211;50 to +49 dB.  Thus, in example message #0003, K1ABC is telling G0XYZ
+that his signal is 19 dB below the noise power in bandwidth 2500 Hz.
+In message #0004, G0XYZ acknowledges receipt of that report and
+responds with a &#8211;22 dB signal report.
+
+TIP: For operators with very good hearing, signals become audible
+around S/N = &#8211;15 dB and visible on the waterfall to &#8211;26 dB. The JT65
+decoder begins to fail around &#8211;24 dB, JT9 around &#8211;26 dB.
+
+*Free Text Messages*: Users often add some friendly chit-chat as a
+final transmission, in place of the formatted ``73'' message.
+Free-format messages such as ``TNX JOE 73 GL'' or `5W VERT 73 GL'' are
+supported, up to a maximum of 13 characters (including spaces).  It
+should be obvious that JT9 and JT65 are not suitable for extensive
+conversations or rag-chewing.
+
+=== Compound Callsigns
+//This section needs work!  Must describe and give examples for both 
+//JT65v1 and JT65v2 formats.
+Compound call-signs such as PJ4/K1ABC or G0XYZ/P are handled in a slightly 
+different way.  The following formats are all valid:

+=== Pre-QSO Checklist
+
+Before attempting your first QSO with JT9 or JT65, be sure to go
+through the &lt;&lt;X15,Basic Tutorial&gt;&gt; above and the following checklist:
+
+- Your callsign and grid locator set to correct values
+- PTT and CAT control (if used) properly configured and tested
+- Computer clock properly synchronized with UTC to within &#177;1 s
+- Radio set to USB (upper sideband) mode
+- Radio's Split mode selected or not, consistent with your choice on
+*Station* tab of *Configuration* window.
+
+- Remember that JT9 and J65 generally do not require high power. Under
+most propagation conditions, [red]*QRP is the rule!*

+.Receiver Noise Level
+- Click the Monitor button to return to normal receive operation.
+- Set your transceiver to USB (or USB Data) mode.  
+- Use the receiver gain control(s) and/or the Windows mixer controls
+to set the background noise level to around 30 dB or mid-scale.  If
+necessary you can also use the slider next to the scale, but note that
+the overall dynamic range will be best with this slider not too far
+from its mid-point.
+
+.Bandwidth and Frequency Setting
+
+Taking full advantage of the wide-band, dual-mode capability of
+{wsjtx} requires a receiver bandwidth of at least 4 kHz. For example,
+on a Kenwood TS-2000 I set *Low Cut* to 200 and *High Cut* to 5000
+Hz. Note that most SSB transceivers have a fixed Tx filter that will
+not pass audio frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  {wsjtx} takes
+care of this by using Split mode, receiving with *VFO A* and
+transmitting with *VFO B*.  The Tx dial frequency (*VFO B*) is offset
+in 500 Hz steps, and the generated audio frequency is adjusted so that
+it always falls in the range 1500 &#8211; 2000 Hz. With *CAT* and *Split Tx*
+enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to 
+*Tx Split* mode, frequency control will be handled automatically.  
+
+If your transceiver has only a standard SSB filter you won&#8217;t be able
+to use more than about 2.7 kHz bandwidth.  You can still have all of
+the JT9 sub-band and part of the JT65 sub-band available, however.  On
+20m, say, set dial frequency (*VFO A*) to 14.0774 and the *JT9 nnnn JT65*
+dividing line at 1600 Hz.  JT9 signals in their conventional sub-band
+will then appear at 1600 &#8211; 2600 Hz, while JT65 signals will be below
+1000 Hz.  Of course, you might prefer to concentrate on one mode at a
+time, setting your dial frequency to (say) 14.076 for JT65 and 14.078
+for JT9.  Present conventions have the nominal JT9 dial frequency 2
+kHz higher than the JT65 dial frequency, and the check-box labeled +2
+kHz, just below the band selector, makes the appropriate settings
+easy.

+.Open a Wave File:
+
+- Select File | Open and navigate to ...\save\samples\130418_1742.wav
+under your program installation directory.  
+
+When the file opens you should see something similar to the to the
+following screen shot:
+
+[[X12]]
+image::images/r3556-main-ui-80.png[align=&quot;center&quot;,alt=&quot;Main UI and Wide Graph&quot;]
+
+.Decoding Overview
+
+Notice the [green]*GREEN* and [red]*RED* markers on the waterfall
+frequency scale.  Decoding takes place at the end of a receive
+sequence and is organized in two stages.  The first decodes take place
+at the selected Rx frequency, indicated by the green marker.  Results
+appear in both the left (&#8220;Band Activity&#8221;) and right (&#8220;Rx Frequency&#8221;)
+text windows on the main screen. The decoder then finds and decodes
+all signals in the selected mode(s) and the displayed frequency
+range. The red marker indicates your Tx frequency.
+
+At least eight JT9 signals are present in the example file; all
+but one of them are decodable.  When this file was recorded KF4RWA was
+finishing a QSO with K1JT.  Since the green marker was placed at his
+audio frequency, 1224 Hz, his message &#8220;K1JT KF4RWA 73&#8221; appears in both
+decoded text windows.  The &#8220;Band Activity&#8221; window shows this message
+as well as all the other decodes at nearby frequencies.  The CQ lines
+are highlighted in [green]*GREEN*, and lines containing &#8220;My Call&#8221;, in
+this case K1JT, are highlighted in [red]*RED*.
+
+TIP: For this step and the next, you may want to pretend you are K1JT by
+entering that call temporarily as &#8220;My Call&#8221; on the &lt;&lt;X11,Configuration
+Screen&gt;&gt;.  Your results should then be identical to those shown in the
+&lt;&lt;X12,screen shot&gt;&gt; above.
+
+[[X13]]
+.Decoding Controls
+To gain some feeling for the controls you will use when making QSOs, try 
+clicking with the mouse on the decoded text lines and on the waterfall spectral 
+display. You should be able to confirm the following behavior:
+
+- Double-click on either of the decoded lines highlighted in green. This action
+should produce the following:
+
+** Copies call-sign and locater of a station calling CQ to the &#8220;DX Call&#8221; 
+and &#8220;DX grid&#8221; entry fields.
+
+** Generates suitable messages for a minimal QSO and checks or clears the Tx
+even box so that you will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.
+
+** Rx and Tx frequency markers will be moved to the CQ-ing station&#8217;s frequency,
+and the Gen Msg (&#8220;generated message&#8221;) radio button at bottom right of the main
+window will be selected.
+
+** If you had checked &#8220;Double-click on call sets Tx Enable&#8221; on the Setup menu,
+Enable Tx would also be activated, and you would start to transmit automatically,
+at the appropriate time.
+
+- Double-click on the decoded line with the message &#8220;K1JT N5KDV EM41&#8221;,
+highlighted in [red]*RED*.  Results will be similar to those in the
+previous step, except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is not
+moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from
+a tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it
+was.
+
+- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
+you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.  This behavior
+can also be forced by checking Lock Tx=Rx. 
+
+- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
+sending &#8220;73&#8221; to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
+want to send 73 to him, so the message &#8220;KF4RWA K1JT 73&#8221; is automatically 
+generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
+choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)
+
+- Clicking on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker) to the 
+selected frequency.
+
+- Ctrl-click on waterfall moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.
+
+- Double-click on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency and causes a 
+narrow-band decode there at the new QSO frequency. Decoded text appears in the 
+right window only.  Ctrl-double-click moves both Rx and Tx frequencies and 
+decodes at the new frequency. 
+
+- Clicking Erase clears the right window. Double-click on Erase to clear both 
+text windows.

+accordingly.
+
+- Scroll back in the Band Activity window and double-click on the

+would configure itself to start a QSO with DL7ACA.
+
+- Double-click on the decoded JT65 message CQ TA4A KM37.  The program
+will set Tx mode to JT9 and the Rx and Tx frequencies to 3567 Hz.  The
+program is now configured properly for a JT9 QSO with TA4A.
+
+IMPORTANT: Don&#8217;t forget to re-enter your own call-sign as &#8220;My Call&#8221;.  
+
+.Reopen the First Sample File:
+- Select File | Open and navigate to ...\save\samples\130418_1742.wav.
+
+These data were recorded with a much narrower Rx bandwidth, roughly
+200 to 2600 Hz. If you have no Rx filter wider than about 2.7 kHz, you
+will be using data like this. For best viewing of such data adjust
+Bins/Pixel and the width of the Wide Graph so that only the active
+part of the spectrum shows, say 0 to 2600 Hz.  Re-open the example
+file after any change of Bins/Pixel or Wide Graph width, to refresh
+the waterfall.
+
+The signals in this file are all JT9 signals.  To decode them in
+JT9+JT65 mode you&#8217;ll need to move the JT65 nnnn JT9 delimiter down to
+1000 Hz or less.
+
+.Start, Zero, and Gain
+Now is a good time to experiment with the *Start*, *Zero*, and
+*Gain* parameters.  *Start* sets the starting frequency at the left
+side of the waterfall scale.  *Zero* sets the baseline level for
+colors, and *Gain* sets the sensitivity for color changes.  For the
+receiver setup of this file good values are *Zero*=0, *Gain*=0.
+Re-open the wave file after each change, to see the new results.

 == Introduction
-{wsjtx} is a computer program designed to facilitate basic amateur
-radio communication using very weak signals.  The first four letters
-in the program name stand for &#8220;Weak Signal communication by K1JT&#8221;, and
-the &#8220;-X&#8221; suffix indicates that {wsjtx} started as an extended (and
-experimental) branch of program WSJT.
+include::introduction.txt[]
 
-{wsjtx} offers two protocols or &#8220;modes,&#8221; JT9 and JT65.  Both are
-designed for making reliable, confirmed QSOs under extreme weak-signal
-conditions. They use nearly identical message structure and source
-encoding.  JT65 was designed for EME (&#8220;moon-bounce&#8221;) on the VHF/UHF
-bands and has also proved very effective for worldwide QRP
-communication at HF.  JT9 is optimized for the LF, MF, and HF bands.
-It is about 2 dB more sensitive than JT65 while using less than 10% of
-the bandwidth.  Both modes use one-minute timed sequences of
-alternating transmission and reception, so a minimal QSO takes four to
-six minutes &#8212; two or three transmissions by each station, one sending
-in odd minutes and the other even.  World-wide QSOs are possible with
-power levels of a few watts and compromise antennas.
-
-Starting with version 1.1, {wsjtx} provides dual-mode reception of
-both JT65 and JT9 signals and can display a bandpass as large as 5
-kHz.  If your receiver can provide at least 4 kHz bandwidth in USB
-mode, you can set your dial frequency to one of the standard JT65
-frequencies &#8212; for example, 14.076 MHz for 20 meters &#8212; and have the
-full JT65 and JT9 sub-bands displayed simultaneously on the waterfall.
-You can make QSOs in both modes using nothing more than mouse clicks.
-
-Plans for future program development call for {wsjtx} and WSJT to merge 
-together: {wsjtx} will gradually acquire the additional modes JT4, FSK441, and 
-ISCAT that are now supported in WSJT.  The entire WSJT-related effort is an 
-open-source project.  If you have programming skills or would like to 
-contribute to the project in other ways, please make your interests known to 
-K1JT and the rest of the development team.  The project&#8217;s source-code 
-repository can be found at {devsvn}, and communication among the 
-developers takes place on the email reflector {devmail}.

+=== Source Code
+include::install-from-source.txt[]
 
-- Source code is available from the public repository at {devsvn}.
-- To compile the program you will need to install open source packages for:
-** Subversion
-** Qt 5.x
-** g++
-** g95 or gfortran
-** fftw3
-** hamlib
+[[X4]]
+== Setup and Configuration
 
-- For compiling in Windows we recommend the MinGW package. 
-- The full source code for {wsjtx} can be downloaded by using the command:
-
-// Need further Windows Compiling Instructions
-
-.[green]_Windows Shell Command_
-[source,bash]
------
-# Open a MSYS-MinGW, Cygwin, etc and:
-svn co <A HREF="svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsjtx">svn://svn.berlios.de/wsjt/branches/wsjtx</A>

-== Configuration
+[[X41]]
 === Station Tab
-- Start {wsjtx} and Select Configuration from its Setup menu.
-* Call Sign: &lt;Your Call Sign&gt;
-* Grid: &lt;Enter Your Maiden Head Grid Square&gt;
-* PskRepoter: enable sending reports, default is off
-* CW ID: Send your call in CW after 73's is sent, default is off
-* CW Interval: set the interval for sending your CW identification. 
-Default is 0 (never).
+include::configuration-station.txt[]
 
-- Many users have other software controlling their radios. {wsjtx} does not 
-implement full transceiver control, but it does provide a way to ensure that 
-{wsjtx} can read and set the radio&#8217;s dial frequency. If you want this 
-capability:
-* Check the box Enable CAT
-* Select your radio type from a drop-down list
-* Select a port (not the same port selected for PTT control)
-* Set COM-port parameters to match selection
+[[X42]]
+=== TX Macros Tab
+include::configuration-txmacros.txt[]
 
-- For now you should leave Split Tx unchecked. If using CAT control,
-most radios will allow you to set PTT method = CAT.  Some radios
-support two types of PTT assertion via CAT control: one takes audio
-input from the Mic connector, the other from a rear-panel Data
-connector.  The simplest CAT configuration sets Polling interval to 0
-(no polling the radio for dial frequency).  {wsjtx} will then be able
-to set the radio&#8217;s frequency, but the program will be unaware of
-subsequent changes made using the radio&#8217;s panel controls.
+[[X43]]
+=== Band Settings Tab
+include::configuration-band-settings.txt[]
 
-.Driver / TTY / USB
-[icon=&quot;./images/icons/example.png&quot;]
-NOTE: If you need an additional item in the list of devices for the
-CAT port, edit the configuration file wsjtx.ini and add your
-requirement as CATdriver=yourdriver. + Example: (
-CATdriver=/dev/tty.usbserial ) in the group of entries marked
-[Common].
-
-- With most radios you can set Polling interval to a reasonable small
-number (say 1 &#8211; 3 s) and the program will follow any frequency changes
-made at the radio.  Note that you may not be able to simultaneously
-control your radio from {wsjtx} and from another software program.
-Some experimentation may be required, and you may need to refer to the
-documentation for your CAT software and radio.
-
-- It is best to have the radio and any interface equipment turned on
-and connected before starting {wsjtx}, and to exit the program before
-turning your equipment off.

-
-- If you use {dxlcommander} or {hrd} to control your transceiver, you
-can configure {wsjtx} to communicate with the radio through that
-program.  Entries for these programs appear at the end of the
-drop-down list of supported rigs:
-
-* For DXL select: DXLab Suite Commander
-* For HRD select: Ham Radio Deluxe
-
-- Try clicking the Test CAT Control and Test PTT buttons to see that
-you have established the desired control of station functions.  Select
-the devices you will use for Audio input and output, then click OK to
-dismiss the Configuration window.
-
-- {wsjtx} expects your sound card to do its raw sampling at 48000 Hz.  To 
-ensure that this will be so when running under Windows:
-
-* Open the Sound control panel and select in turn the &#8220;Recording&#8221; and
-&#8220;Playback&#8221; options.  * Click on Properties, then Advanced, and select
-&#8220;16 bit, 48000 Hz (DVD Quality).&#8221;
-
-CAUTION: If you are using a sound card that is also the default device
-for Windows sounds, be sure to turn off all such sounds so they are
-not transmitted over the air.
-
-==== TX Macros Tab
-
-- TX Macros are an aid for sending commonly used free-text messages.
-To enable a pull-down selection, add your custom messages to the entry
-fields provided.  Remember that the maximum free-text message length
-is 13 characters.  You access your macros by selecting Tx message #5
-(or the Free MSG Radio Button) on the main window, then right-click to
-select the message to be sent.
-
-==== Band Settings Tab
-
-- Band Settings set the frequency by band and what antenna is being
-used on each.  The data is used on the Main menu as well as things
-like PskRepoter. If this information is incorrect, with respect to
-bands, so will your data being sent out.

+[[X44]]
 === Main Window
-- To set the proper level of audio drive from {wsjtx} to your radio:
+include::configuration-main-window.txt[]
 
-* Click the Tune button on the main screen.{wsjtx} should set the
-radio into transmit mode and generate a steady audio tone at the same
-amplitude that will be used for a generated JT9 signal.
+[[X45]]
+=== Font Sizes
+include::font-sizes.txt[]
 
-* Listen to the generated audio tone using your radio&#8217;s &#8220;Monitor&#8221;
-facility, or by another method.  The tone should be perfectly smooth,
-with no clicks or glitches.
-
-* Open the computer&#8217;s audio mixer controls for output (&#8220;playback&#8221;)
-devices and adjust the volume slider downward until the RF output from
-your transmitter falls by around 10%.  This will be a good level for
-audio drive.
-
-* Alternatively, you can make the same adjustment using the digital
-slider labeled Pwr at bottom right of the main window.
-
-* Toggle the Tune button once more to stop your test transmission.

-
-==== Decoding Overview
-
-- Notice the [green]*GREEN* and [red]*RED* markers on the waterfall
-frequency scale.  Decoding takes place at the end of a receive
-sequence and is organized in two stages.  The first decodes take place
-at the selected Rx frequency, indicated by the green marker.  Results
-appear in both the left (&#8220;Band Activity&#8221;) and right (&#8220;Rx Frequency&#8221;)
-text windows on the main screen. The decoder then finds and decodes
-all signals in the selected mode(s) and the displayed frequency
-range. The red marker indicates your Tx frequency.
-
-.Signal Presence
-
-NOTE: At least eight JT9 signals are present in the example file; all
-but one of them are decodable.  When this file was recorded KF4RWA was
-finishing a QSO with K1JT.  Since the green marker was placed at his
-audio frequency, 1224 Hz, his message &#8220;K1JT KF4RWA 73&#8221; appears in both
-decoded text windows.  The &#8220;Band Activity&#8221; window shows this message
-as well as all the other decodes at nearby frequencies.  The CQ lines
-are highlighted in [green]*GREEN*, and lines containing &#8220;My Call&#8221;, in
-this case K1JT, are highlighted in [red]*RED*.
-
-- For this step and the next, you may want to pretend you are K1JT by
-entering that call temporarily as &#8220;My Call&#8221; on the &lt;&lt;X11,Configuration
-Screen&gt;&gt;.  Your results should then be identical to those shown in the
-&lt;&lt;X12,figure above&gt;&gt;.
-
-[[X13]]
-==== Decoding Controls
-- To gain some feeling for the controls you will use when making QSOs, try 
-clicking with the mouse on the decoded text lines and on the waterfall spectral 
-display. You should be able to confirm the following behavior:
-
-- Double-click on either of the decoded lines highlighted in green. This action
-should produce the following:
-
-** Copies call-sign and locater of a station calling CQ to the &#8220;DX Call&#8221; 
-and &#8220;DX grid&#8221; entry fields.
-
-** Generates suitable messages for a minimal QSO and checks or clears the Tx
-even box so that you will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.
-
-** Rx and Tx frequency markers will be moved to the CQ-ing station&#8217;s frequency,
-and the Gen Msg (&#8220;generated message&#8221;) radio button at bottom right of the main
-window will be selected.
-
-** If you had checked &#8220;Double-click on call sets Tx Enable&#8221; on the Setup menu,
-Enable Tx would also be activated, and you would start to transmit automatically,
-at the appropriate time.
-
-- Double-click on the decoded line with the message &#8220;K1JT N5KDV EM41&#8221;, 
-highlighted in [red]*RED*.
-
-- Results will be similar to (a), except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is
-not moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from a 
-tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it was.
-
-- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
-(or checking Lock Tx=Rx) you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.
-
-- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
-sending &#8220;73&#8221; to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
-want to send 73 to him, so the message &#8220;KF4RWA K1JT 73&#8221; is automatically 
-generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
-choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)
-
-- Clicking on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker) to the 
-selected frequency.
-
-- Ctrl-click on waterfall moves both Rx and Tx frequencies.
-
-- Double-click on the waterfall moves the Rx frequency and causes a 
-narrow-band decode there at the new QSO frequency. Decoded text appears in the 
-right window only.  Ctrl-double-click moves both Rx and Tx frequencies and 
-decodes at the new frequency. 
-
-- Clicking Erase clears the right window. Double-click on Erase to clear both 
-text windows.

-[NOTE]
-If necessary, adjust the width of the Wide Graph Window so that the upper

-
-==== Main Window
-- Select JT9+JT65 on the Mode menu
-- Toggle the Tx mode button to read Tx JT65, and set the Tx and Rx frequencies
-to 1718 Hz.

-This sample file contains 17 decodable signals &#8212; nine in JT65 mode
-(flagged with the character # in the decoded text windows), and eight
-in JT9 mode (flagged with @).  Since the Tx mode was set to Tx JT65,
-signals in that mode were decoded first.  If you had selected Tx JT9,
-JT9 signals would have been decoded first.

-
-NOTE: Notice the [blue]*BLUE* marker on the waterfall scale, by
-default set at 2500 Hz.  Its position is set by the spinner control
-JT65 nnnn JT9, where nnnn is a frequency in Hz. In JT9+JT65 mode the
-program will decode JT65 signals below this frequency and JT9 signals
-above it.
-
-- Confirm that mouse-click behavior is similar to that described in
-the single-mode instructions at &lt;&lt;X13,Decoding Controls&gt;&gt;. The program
-automatically determines the mode of each JT9 or JT65 signal.
-
-==== Check Decodes
-- Double-click on the waterfall near 815 Hz: a signal originating
-from W7VP will be decoded and appear in the Rx Frequency Box:
-
-.W7VP Decode
-[width=&quot;70%&quot;,cols=&quot;3,^3,^3,^4,^4,30&quot;,options=&quot;header&quot;]

-|UTC|db|dt|Freq|Mode|Message
-|2343|-7|0.3|815|#|KK4DSD W7VP -16
-|=================================
-
-- Double-click on the waterfall at 3196 Hz and the program will decode a JT9
-message from IZ0MIT:
-
-.IZ0MIT Decode
-[width=&quot;70%&quot;,cols=&quot;3,^3,^3,^4,^4,30&quot;,options=&quot;header&quot;]
-|=====================================
-|UTC|db|dt|Freq|Mode|Message
-|2343|-7|0.3|3196|@|WB8QPG IZ0MIT -11
-|=====================================
-
-NOTE: Notice that when a signal is decoded in this way the Tx mode
-automatically switches to that of the decoded signal.  The Rx and Tx
-frequency markers on the waterfall scale resize themselves
-accordingly.
-
-- Scroll back in the Band Activity window (if necessary) and
-double-click on the message CQ DL7ACA JO40.  The program will set Tx
-mode to JT65 and Tx and Rx frequencies to that of DL7ACA, 975 Hz.  If
-you had checked *Double-click on call sets Tx Enable* on the Setup menu,
-the program would set up to start a QSO with DL7ACA.
-
-- Double-click on the decoded JT65 message CQ TA4A KM37.  The program
-will set Tx mode to JT9 and the Rx and Tx frequencies to 3567 Hz.
-You&#8217;re now configured properly for a JT9 QSO with TA4A.
-
-==== 130418_1742.wav

-
-- You can immediately see that these data were recorded with a much
-narrower Rx bandwidth, roughly 200 to 2600 Hz. If you have no Rx
-filter wider than about 2.7 kHz, you will be using data similar to
-this sample. For best viewing of such data adjust Bins/Pixel and the
-width of the Wide Graph so that only the active part of the spectrum
-shows, say 0 to 2600 Hz.  (Re-open the example file after any change
-of Bins/Pixel or Wide Graph width, to refresh the waterfall.)  The
-signals in this file are all JT9 signals.  To decode them in JT9+JT65
-mode you&#8217;ll need to move the JT65 nnnn JT9 delimiter down to 1000 Hz
-or less.
-
-=== Start, Zero, and Gain
-
-- Now is a good time to experiment with the *Start*, *Zero*, and
-*Gain* parameters.  *Start* sets the starting frequency at the left
-side of the waterfall scale.  *Zero* sets the baseline level for
-colors, and *Gain* sets the sensitivity for color changes.  For the
-receiver setup of this file good values are *Zero*=0, *Gain*=0.
-Re-open the wave file after each change, to see the new results.
-
-=== Noise Level
-
-- Don&#8217;t forget to re-enter your own call-sign as &#8220;My Call&#8221;.  Click the
-Monitor button to return to normal receive operation, and be sure that
-your transceiver is set to USB (or USB Data) mode.  Using the receiver
-gain control(s) and/or the Windows mixer controls, set the background
-noise level (lower left of main window) to around 30 dB or mid-scale.
-If necessary you can also use the slider next to the scale &#8212; but note
-that the overall dynamic range will be best with this slider not too
-far from its mid-point.
-
-=== Freq Setting
-
-- Taking full advantage of the wide-band, dual-mode capability of
-{wsjtx} requires a receiver bandwidth of at least 4 kHz. For example,
-on a Kenwood TS-2000 I set *Low Cut* to 200 and *High Cut* to 5000
-Hz. Note that most SSB transceivers have a fixed Tx filter that will
-not pass audio frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  {wsjtx} takes
-care of this by using Split mode, receiving with VFO A and
-transmitting with VFO B.  The Tx dial frequency (VFO B) is offset in
-500 Hz steps, and the generated audio frequency is adjusted so that it
-always falls in the range 1500 &#8211; 2000 Hz. With CAT and Split Tx
-enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to Split
-mode, frequency control will be handled automatically.  (Note:
-operating in Split mode is not yet functional with CAT control through
-{hrd}.
-
-=== Filters
-
-- If your transceiver has only a standard SSB filter you won&#8217;t be able
-to use more than about 2.7 kHz bandwidth.  You can still have all of
-the JT9 sub-band and part of the JT65 sub-band available, however.  On
-20m, say, set dial frequency (VFO A) to 14.0774 and the JT9 nnnn JT65
-dividing line at 1600 Hz.  JT9 signals in their conventional sub-band
-will then appear at 1600 &#8211; 2600 Hz, while JT65 signals will be below
-1000 Hz.  Of course, you might prefer to concentrate on one mode at a
-time, setting your dial frequency to (say) 14.076 for JT65 and 14.078
-for JT9.  Present conventions have the nominal JT9 dial frequency 2
-kHz higher than the JT65 dial frequency, and the check-box labeled \+2
-kHz, just below the band selector, makes the appropriate settings
-easy.
-

 == Making QSOs
+include::make-qso.txt[]
 
-- At this point, you should now be ready to make QSOs using either JT9 or JT65.
-
-- By longstanding tradition, a minimal valid QSO requires the exchange
-of callsigns, a signal report or some other information, and
-acknowledgments.  {wsjtx} is designed to facilitate making such
-minimal QSOs using short, formatted messages.  The process works best
-if you use these formats and follow standard operating practices.  The
-recommended basic QSO goes something like this:
-
-=== Standard Exchange
-.Sequence of Events
-[width=&quot;70%&quot;,cols=&quot;3,^3,^3,^4,10&quot;,options=&quot;header&quot;]
-|=======================================
-|UTC|To|From|Grid/Rpt|Comment
-|0001|CQ|K1ABC|FN42|~ K1ABC calls CQ
-|0002|K1ABC|G0XYZ|IO91|~ G0XYZ answers
-|0003|G0XYZ|K1ABC|&#8211;19|~ K1ABC sends report
-|0004|K1ABC|G0XYZ|R&#8211;22|~ G0XYZ sends acknowledgment and report
-|0005|G0XYZ|K1ABC|RRR|~ K1ABC sends acknowledgment
-|0006|K1ABC|G0XYZ|73|~ G0XYZ sends 73
-|=======================================
-
-- These standard messages consist of two callsigns (or CQ, QRZ, or DE
-and one callsign) followed by the transmitting station&#8217;s grid locator,
-a signal report, or the acknowledgement &#8220;RRR&#8221; or &#8220;73&#8221;.
-
-- These structured messages are compressed and encoded in a highly
-efficient and reliable way.  Signal reports are given as
-signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in dB, using the standard reference noise
-bandwidth 2500 Hz.
-
-- For JT65 reports must lie in the range &#8211;30 to &#8211;1 dB; JT9 supports
-the extended range &#8211;50 to \+49 dB.  
-
-* In the example message #0003, K1ABC is telling G0XYZ that his signal
-is 19 dB below the noise power in bandwidth 2500 Hz.
-
-* In message #4, G0XYZ acknowledges receipt of that report and
-responds with a &#8211;22 dB signal report.
-
-- For operators with good hearing, signals start to become audible
-around &#8211;15 dB on this scale.
-
-- Signals are visible on the waterfall down to about &#8211;26 dB.
-
-NOTE: In ideal circumstances the JT65 decoder begins to fail around
-&#8211;24 dB, JT9 around &#8211;26 dB.
-
-=== Message Format
-
-- Users often add some friendly chit-chat as a final transmission, in
-place of the formatted ``73'' message.  Free-format messages such as
-``TNX JOE 73 GL'' or `5W VERT 73 GL'' are supported, up to a maximum
-of 13 characters.  It should be obvious, however, that JT9 and JT65
-are not suitable for extensive conversations or rag-chewing.
-
-=== Compound Call-Signs
-- Compound call-signs such as PJ4/K1ABC or G0XYZ/P are handled in a slightly 
-different way.  The following formats are all valid:

-=== Pre-QSO Checks
-
-- Before attempting your first QSO with JT9 or JT65, be sure to go
-through the &lt;&lt;X15,Basic Tutorial&gt;&gt; as well as the following checklist:
-
-* Your callsign and grid locator set to correct values
-* PTT and CAT control (if used) properly configured and tested
-* Computer clock properly synchronized with UTC to within &#177;1 s.
-* Radio set to USB (upper sideband) mode
-
-IMPORTANT: Remember that JT9 and J65 generally do not require high
-power. Under most propagation conditions, [red]*QRP is the rule!*

 == Controls &amp; Functions
+include::controls-functions.txt[]
 
-- This section will go through the various menus, screens, control and
-functions for both the Main UI and Wide Graph. Small variations may
-exist between displayed images and that of the application.
-
+[[X71]]
 === Wide Graph Controls
-- The following controls appear at the bottom of the Wide Graph window:
+include::controls-functions-wide-graph.txt[]
 
-.Wide Graph Controls
-image::images/wide-graph-controls.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Wide Graph Controls&quot;]
-
-* *FFT Bins/Pixel* controls the displayed frequency resolution.  Set
-to 1 for the highest possible resolution, or to higher values to
-compress the spectral display. Normal operation with a convenient
-window size works well at 2 to 8 bins per pixel.
-
-* *N Avg* is the number of successive FFTs to be averaged before
-updating the spectral display.  Values around 5 are suitable for
-normal JT9 and JT65 operation.
-
-* *Gain* and *Zero* control the scaling and reference level for
-waterfall colors.  Values around 0 for both parameters are usually
-about right, depending on the input signal level and your own
-preferences.
-
-* *JT65 nnnn JT9* sets the dividing point for wide-band decoding of
-JT65 and JT9 signals in JT9+JT65 mode.  The decoder looks for JT65
-signals below nnnn Hz and JT9 signals above that frequency.
-
-* *Current / Cumulative* controls the graphical display in the bottom
-one-third of the Wide Graph window.  ** Current is the average
-spectrum over the most recent N Avg FFT calculations.  ** Cumulative

-- The following buttons appear just under the decoded text windows on
-the main screen:
-
-.Main UI Controls
-image::images/main-ui-controls.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Main UI Controls&quot;]
-
-* *Log QSO* pops up a confirmation screen pre-filled with known
-information about a QSO you have nearly completed.  You can edit or
-add to this information before clicking OK to log the QSO.  If you
-select ``Prompt me to log QSO'' on the Setup menu, the program will
-pop up the confirmation screen automatically when you send a ``73'' or
-free-text message.
-
-.Log QSO Window
-image::images/log-qso.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Log QSO&quot;]
-
-* *Stop* will stop normal data acquisition in case you want to open
-and explore previously recorded audio files.
-
-* *Monitor* restarts normal receive operation.  This button is
-highlighted in green when the program is receiving.
-
-* *Decode* tells the program to repeat the decoding procedure at the
-Rx frequency (green marker on waterfall), using the most recently
-completed sequence of Rx data.
-
-* *Erase* clears the right (Rx frequency) window. Double-clicking
-Erase clears both text windows.
-
-* *Tune* may be used to switch into Tx mode and generate an
-unmodulated carrier at the specified Tx frequency (red marker on
-waterfall).  This process may be seful for adjusting an antenna tuner,
-for example, toggle the button a second time to terminate the Tune
-process.
-
-* *Enable Tx* puts the program into automatic Rx/Tx sequencing mode
-and highlights the button in red.  A transmission will start at the
-beginning of the selected (odd or even) sequence, or immediately if
-appropriate.
-
-* *Halt Tx* terminates a transmission in progress and disables
-automatic Rx/Tx sequencing.

-window:
-
-.Misc Controls Left
-image::images/misc-main-ui.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Mist Menu Items&quot;]
-
-* The drop-down Band selector at upper left lets you select the
-operating band and sets dial frequency to a default value taken from
-the Default Frequencies tab on the Setup | Configuration screen.
-
-* If you are using CAT control, a small colored square appears in
-green if the CAT control is two-way between {wsjtx} and your radio, or
-orange if the control is only from program to radio.  (You can request
-a one-time interrogation of the radio&#8217;s dial frequency by clicking on
-the orange square.) The square becomes red if you have requested CAT
-control but communication with the radio has been lost.  If the Dx
-Grid is known, the great-circle azimuth and distance are given.
-
-* The program can keep a database of call-signs and locators for
-future reference.  Click Add to insert the present call and locater in
-the database; click Lookup to retrieve the locator for a previously
-stored call-sign.
-
+[[X74]]
 === Misc Controls Center
+include::controls-functions-center.txt[]
 
-* At the center of the main window are a number of controls you will
-use when making QSOs:
+[[X75]]
+=== Tx Messages
+include::controls-functions-messages.txt[]
 
-.Misc Controls Center
-image::images/misc-controls-center.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Misc Controls Center&quot;]
-
-* Select *Tx even* to transmit in even-numbered UTC minutes.  Uncheck
-this box to transmit in the odd intervals.  This selection is made
-automatically when you double-click on a decoded text line as
-described in the Basic Operating Tutorial, Sections 5.1 thru 5.8.
-
-* Your audio Tx and Rx frequencies are displayed and can be adjusted
-with spinner controls. These settings are normally handled
-automatically by the double-click procedure.
-
-* The on-the-air frequency of your lowest JT9 or JT65 tone is the sum
-of dial and audio frequencies.  You can force Tx frequency to the
-current Rx frequency by clicking the Tx=Rx button, and vice-versa for
-Rx=Tx; check the box Lock Tx=Rx to make the frequencies always track
-one another.
-
-The *Report* control lets you change a signal report inserted
-automatically. Most reports will fall in the range &#8211;26 to \+10 dB.
-When signals are close to or above 0 dB, you and your QSO partner
-should probably reduce power. JT65 and JT9 are supposed to be weak
-signal modes!
-
-=== Message Menus
-* Two configurations of controls are provided for generating and selecting Tx 
-messages:
-
-.Traditional Message Control Panel
-* Traditional controls (carried over from program WSJT) provide six
-fields for message entry.  Pre-formatted messages for the standard
-minimal QSO are generated when you click Generate Std Msgs, or when
-you double-click on an appropriate line of decoded text.
-
-.Traditional Message Menu
-image::images/traditional-msg-box.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;Traditional Message Menu&quot;]
-
-* Select the next message to be transmitted (at the start of your next
-Tx\ sequence) by clicking on the circle under
-
-* Next to change to a specified Tx message immediately, perhaps after
-a transmission has already started, click on a rectangular button
-(e.g., Tx 3) under the Now label.  Changing Tx messages after a
-transmission has started reduces the probability of a correct decode
-by your QSO partner, but if you do it in the first 10 s of a Tx period
-it will most likely succeed.  Right-clicking on the entry field for
-message #5 pops up a list of free text messages entered on the Setup |
-Configuration | Tx Macros dialog window, for example you can select
-any of these pre-stored messages with the left mouse button.
-
-.New Message Control Panel
-* The second configuration of message-selecting controls looks like this:
-
-.New Message Menu
-image::images/new-msg-box.png[align=&quot;left&quot;,alt=&quot;New Message Menu&quot;]
-
-* With this setup you will normally follow a top-to-bottom sequence of
-transmissions from the left column (if you are calling CQ) or the
-right column (if you are answering a CQ).  Clicking a button puts the
-appropriate message in the Gen Msg box.  If you are already
-transmitting, it changes the Tx message immediately.  The actual
-message being transmitted always appears highlighted in yellow in the
-first box on the status bar, at the bottom left of the main screen.
-You can enter anything (up to 13 characters) in the Free Msg box.
-Right-clicking on this entry field pops up your previously defined
-list of Tx Macros.

-== Font Sizes
-
-- User control of font sizes can be effected by using a text editor
-(Windows Notepad or similar) to create a one-line file named fonts.txt
-in the wsjtx directory. A single line of text should contain four
-numbers separated by spaces.  The first two control the font size (in
-points) and weight (on a 0 &#8211; 100 scale) of most GUI labels. The last
-two numbers control size and weight of text in the Band Activity and
-Rx Frequency windows.
-
-- The default is ``8 50 10 50''. If you need larger fonts and bold
-text in the decode windows, try ``10 50 12 100'' (without the quotes).

 == JT65 &amp; JT9 Differences
+include::jt65-jt9-differences.txt[]
 
-- *JT65* is a mature mode described in the literature some years
-ago. Details of the *JT9* protocol are presented in &lt;&lt;X16,Appendix A&gt;&gt;
-of this Guide.
-
-- To users already familiar with *JT65*, the most striking difference
-between the two modes is the much smaller occupied bandwidth of JT9:
-15.6 Hz, compared with 177.6 Hz for *JT65A*. Transmissions in the two
-modes are essentially the same length, and both modes use exactly 72
-bits to carry message information.  At the user level the two modes
-support the same message structures.
-
-- *JT65* signal reports are constrained to the range &#8211;1 to &#8211;30 dB &#8212;
-more than adequate for EME purposes, but not enough dynamic range for
-ideal use at HF and below.
-
-- S/N values displayed by the *JT65* decoder are clamped at &#8211;1 dB,
-because that&#8217;s all the original protocol can handle; the S/N scale in
-present *JT65* decoders becomes increasingly nonlinear above &#8211;10 dB.
-
-- By comparison, *JT9* allows for signal reports in the range &#8211;50 to
-\+49 dB.  It manages this by co-opting a small amount of message space
-otherwise used for grid locator's within 1 degree of the south
-pole. The S/N scale of the present *JT9* decoder is reasonably linear,
-although it&#8217;s not intended as a precision measurement tool. With clean
-signals in a clean nose background, *JT65* achieves nearly 100%
-probability of correct decoding down to S/N = &#8211;22 dB and 50% at &#8211;24
-dB.  *JT9* is about 2 dB better, achieving 50% decoding at about &#8211;26
-dB.  Both modes produce extremely low false-decode rates.
-
-- Early experience suggests that under most HF propagation conditions
-the two modes have comparable reliability, with perhaps a slight edge
-to *JT9*. The tone spacing of *JT9* is about two-thirds that of
-*JT65*, so in some disturbed ionospheric conditions in the higher
-portion of the HF spectrum, *JT65* may do better. *JT9* is an order of
-magnitude better in spectral efficiency. On a busy HF band, we often
-find the 2-kHz-wide *JT65* sub-band filled wall-to-wall with signals.
-Ten times as many JT9 signals could fit into the same space, without
-overlap.
-
-[[X16]]
+[[XA10]]
 == Appendix A
-.The JT9 Protocol and its Implementation
+include::app-a.txt[]
 
-- *JT9* is a mode designed for making QSOs at HF, MF, and LF.  The
-mode uses essentially the same 72-bit structured messages as *JT65*.
-
-- Error control coding (ECC) uses a strong convolutional code with
-constraint length K=32, rate r=1/2, and a zero tail.  WIth 72-bit
-user messages, this leads to an encoded message length of 
-(72+31) &#215; 2 = 206 bits.
-
-- Modulation is 9-FSK: 8 tone frequencies for data, and one for
-synchronization.  In a given transmission sixteen tone intervals
-(those numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 16, 23, 33, 35, 51, 52, 55, 60, 66, 73,
-83, and 85 in the sequence) are devoted to synchronization.  Thus, a
-transmission requires a total of (206 / 3) + 16 = 85 (rounded up) tone
-intervals.
-
-- Symbol lengths are chosen so that nsps, the number of samples
-per symbol (at 12000 samples per second) is a number with no prime
-factor greater than 7.  This choice makes for efficient FFTs. Tone
-spacing of the 9-FSK modulation is:
-
------  
-df = 1 / tsym = 12000 / nsps, equal to the keying rate
------
-
-- Symbol durations are approximately (TRperiod - 8) / 85, where
-TRperiod is the T/R sequence length in seconds.
-
-
-- The total occupied bandwidth is 9 &#215; df. The generated signal has
-continuous phase and constant amplitude, so there are no key
-clicks. For experimental purposes, submodes of *JT9* were defined with
-transmission lengths greater than one minute.
-
-- Parameters of all submodes are summarized in the following table,
-along with approximate decoding thresholds measured by simulation on
-an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Numbers following
-*``JT9-''* in the submode names specify the T/R sequence length in
-minutes.  When not otherwise specified in this Guide, *JT9* implies
-submode *JT9-1*, the only submode implemented in current versions of
-{wsjtx}.

 === Transmitting
+include::app-a-transmitting.txt[]
 
-- Immediately before the start of a transmission {wsjtx} encodes a
-user&#8217;s message and computes the sequence of tones to be sent.  The
-transmitted audio waveform is computed on-the-fly, with 16-bit integer
-samples at a 48000 Hz rate.  The digital samples are converted to an
-analog waveform in the sound card or equivalent USB interface.
-
+[[XA13]]
 === Receiving &amp; Decoding
+include::app-a-rcv-decode.txt[]
 
-- {wsjtx} acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a
-12000 Hz rate.  Spectra from overlapping data segments are computed
-for the waterfall display and saved at intervals of half the JT9
-symbol length.
-
-- As shown in screen shots earlier in this Guide, a *JT9* signal
-appears in the Cumulative spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about
-16 Hz wide.  Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the
-one in *JT65*, by convention the nominal frequency of a *JT9* signal
-is nevertheless taken to be that of the lowest tone at the left edge
-of the spectrum.
-
-- At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
-minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
-operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
-twice:
-
-* first over a narrow range around the selected Rx frequency
-
-* Then in the full displayed frequency range (or in *JT9+JT65* mode, the
-displayed range above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).
-
-- Decoding of clean *JT9* signals in a white-noise background starts
-to fail around signal-to-noise ratio &#8211;25 dB and reached the 50% level
-at -26 dB
-
-- Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.

-
-- With marginal or unrecognizable signals the sequential {shannonfano}
-can take exponentially long times to completion.
-
-- If the first step in the above sequence finds many seemingly worthy
-candidate signals, and if many of them turn out to be undecodable, the
-decoding loop could take a very long time.
-
-- For this reason the decode9 step is programmed to &#8220;time out&#8221; and
-report failure if it takes too long.

-been &#8220;open source&#8221;, all code being licensed under the GNU Public
-License (GPL).
-
-- For {wsjtx} in particular, I wish to acknowledge contributions from:
-*AC6SL, AE4JY, DJ0OT, G4KLA, G4WJS, K3WYC, KA6MAL, KA9Q, KK1D, PY2SDR,
-VK3ACF, VK4BDJ, and W4TV*.
-
-- Each has helped to bring the program&#8217;s design, code, and
-documentation to its present state. Most of the color palettes for the
-{wsjtx} waterfall were shamelessly copied from the excellent, well
-documented, open-source program fldigi, by W1HKJ and friends.
