 .Bandwidth and Frequency Setting
 
 Taking full advantage of the wide-band, dual-mode capability of
-{wsjtx} requires a receiver bandwidth of at least 4 kHz. For example,
-on a Kenwood TS-2000 I set *Low Cut* to 200 and *High Cut* to 5000
-Hz. Note that most SSB transceivers have a fixed Tx filter that will
-not pass audio frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  {wsjtx} takes
-care of this by using Split mode, receiving with *VFO A* and
-transmitting with *VFO B*.  The Tx dial frequency (*VFO B*) is offset
-in 500 Hz steps, and the generated audio frequency is adjusted so that
+_WSJT-X_ requires a receiver bandwidth of at least 4 kHz.  Many SSB
+transceivers have a fixed-width Tx filter that will not pass audio
+frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  _WSJT-X_ takes care of this by
+using Split mode, receiving with *VFO A* and transmitting with *VFO
+B*.  Under CAT control _WSJT-X_ offsets the Tx dial frequency (*VFO
+B*) in 500 Hz steps, adjusting the generated audio frequency so that
 it always falls in the range 1500 &#8211; 2000 Hz. With *CAT* and *Split Tx*
-enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to 
-*Tx Split* mode, frequency control will be handled automatically.  
+enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to *Tx
+Split* mode, this frequency control will be handled automatically.
 
 If your transceiver has only a standard SSB filter you won&#8217;t be able
 to use more than about 2.7 kHz bandwidth.  You can still have all of
-the JT9 sub-band and part of the JT65 sub-band available, however.  On
-20m, say, set dial frequency (*VFO A*) to 14.0774 and the *JT9 nnnn JT65*
-dividing line at 1600 Hz.  JT9 signals in their conventional sub-band
-will then appear at 1600 &#8211; 2600 Hz, while JT65 signals will be below
-1000 Hz.  Of course, you might prefer to concentrate on one mode at a
-time, setting your dial frequency to (say) 14.076 for JT65 and 14.078
-for JT9.  Present conventions have the nominal JT9 dial frequency 2
-kHz higher than the JT65 dial frequency, and the check-box labeled +2
