+The JT65 protocol was described in a {jt65protocol} in 2005; details
+of the JT9 protocol are presented in the next section of this Guide.
+To users already familiar with JT65, the most striking difference
+between the two modes is the much smaller occupied bandwidth of JT9:
+15.6 Hz, compared with 177.6 Hz for JT65A.  Transmissions in the two
+modes are essentially the same length, and both modes use exactly 72
+bits to carry message information.  At the user level the two modes
+support nearly identical message structures.
+
+JT65 signal reports are constrained to the range &#8211;1 to &#8211;30 dB.  This
+range is more than adequate for EME purposes, but not enough for
+optimum use at HF and below.  S/N values displayed by the JT65 decoder
+are clamped at an upper limit &#8211;1 dB.  Moreover, the S/N scale in
+present JT65 decoders is nonlinear above &#8211;10 dB.  
+
+By comparison, JT9 allows for signal reports in the range &#8211;50 to +49
+dB.  It manages this by taking over a small portion of ``message
+space'' that would otherwise be used for grid locators within 1 degree
+of the south pole. The S/N scale of the present JT9 decoder is
+reasonably linear (although it&#8217;s not intended to be a precision
+measurement tool).  With clean signals and a clean nose background,
+JT65 achieves nearly 100% probability of correct decoding down to 
+S/N = &#8211;22 dB and about 50% at &#8211;24 dB.  JT9 is about 2 dB better, 
+achieving 50% decoding at about &#8211;26 dB.  Both modes produce extremely 
+low false-decode rates.
+
+Early experience suggests that under most HF propagation conditions
+the two modes have comparable reliability.  The tone spacing of JT9 is
+about two-thirds that of JT65, so in some disturbed ionospheric
+conditions in the higher portion of the HF spectrum, JT65 may do
+better. JT9 is an order of magnitude better in spectral efficiency.
+On a busy HF band, we often find the 2-kHz-wide JT65 sub-band filled
+wall-to-wall with signals.  Ten times as many JT9 signals can fit

+JT9 is a mode designed for making minimal QSOs at LF, MF, and HF.  It
+uses 72-bit structured messages nearly identical (at the user level)
+to those in JT65.  Error control coding (ECC) uses a strong
+convolutional code with constraint length K=32, rate r=1/2, and a zero
+tail, leading to an encoded message length of (72+31) &#215; 2 = 206
+information-carrying bits.  Modulation is 9-FSK: eight tones are used
+for data, one for synchronization.  Thus, three data bits or one
+synchronization bit are conveyed by each transmitted symbol.  Sixteen
+symbol intervals are devoted to synchronization, so a transmission
+requires a total of 206 / 3 + 16 = 85 (rounded up) channel
+symbols. The sync symbols are those numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 16, 23, 33,
+35, 51, 52, 55, 60, 66, 73, 83, and 85 in the transmitted sequence.
+
+Each symbol lasts for 6912 sample intervals at 12000 samples per
+second, or about 0.576 s.  Tone spacing of the 9-FSK modulation is
+12000/6912 = 1.736 Hz, the inverse of the symbol duration.  The total
+occupied bandwidth is 9 &#215; 1.736 = 15.6 Hz.  A generated JT9 signal has
+continuous phase and constant amplitude.  There are no key clicks, and
+the transmitter's power amplifier need not be highly linear.
+
+.Transmitting
+
+Immediately before the start of a transmission WSJT-X encodes a
+user&#8217;s message and computes the sequence of tones to be sent.  The
+transmitted audio waveform is computed on-the-fly, using 16-bit
+integer samples at a 48000 Hz rate.  The digital samples are converted
+to an analog waveform in the sound card or equivalent D/A interface.
+
+.Receiving and Decoding
+
+WSJT-X acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a 48000
+Hz rate, and immediately downsamples the stream to 12000 Hz.  Spectra
+from overlapping segments are computed for the waterfall display and
+saved at intervals of 0.188 s, half the JT9 symbol length.  As shown
+in screen shots earlier in this guide, a JT9 signal appears in the
+*Cumulative* spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about 16 Hz wide.
+Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the one at the
+low-frequency edge of a JT65 signal, by convention the nominal
+frequency of a JT9 signal is taken to be that of the lowest tone, at
+the left edge of the spectrum.
+
+At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
+minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
+operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
+twice: first at the selected Rx frequency, and then in the full
+displayed frequency range (or in JT9+JT65 mode, the displayed range
+above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).  Decoding of clean JT9 signals
+in a white-noise background starts to fail below signal-to-noise
+ratio &#8211;25 dB and reaches 50% copy at -26 dB.

+minimal QSOs using short, formatted messages.  The process works best
+if you use these formats and follow standard operating practices.  The
+recommended basic QSO goes something like this:
+
+[width=&quot;90%&quot;,cols=&quot;3,7,12&quot;,options=&quot;header&quot;]
+|=======================================
+|UTC|Transmitted Message|Comment
+|0001|CQ K1ABC FN42|K1ABC calls CQ
+|0002|K1ABC G0XYZ IO91|G0XYZ answers
+|0003|G0XYZ K1ABC &#8211;19|K1ABC sends report
+|0004|K1ABC G0XYZ R&#8211;22|G0XYZ sends acknowledgment and report
+|0005|G0XYZ K1ABC RRR|K1ABC sends acknowledgment
+|0006|K1ABC G0XYZ 73|G0XYZ sends 73
+|=======================================
+
+*Standard messages* consist of two callsigns (or CQ, QRZ, or DE and
+one callsign) followed by the transmitting station&#8217;s grid locator, a
+signal report, acknowledgement R plus a signal report, or the final
+acknowledgements RRR or 73.  Messages are compressed and encoded
+in a highly efficient and reliable way.  
+
+*Signal reports* are specified as signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) in dB,
+using a standard reference noise bandwidth 2500 Hz.  JT65 reports must
+lie in the range &#8211;30 to &#8211;1 dB, while JT9 supports the extended range
+&#8211;50 to +49 dB.  Thus, in example message #0003, K1ABC is telling G0XYZ
+that his signal is 19 dB below the noise power in bandwidth 2500 Hz.
+In message #0004, G0XYZ acknowledges receipt of that report and
+responds with a &#8211;22 dB signal report.
+
+TIP: Signals become visible on the waterfall around S/N = &#8211;26 dB and
+audible around &#8211;15 dB. Thresholds for signal decodability are
+approximately &#8211;24 dB for JT65, &#8211;26 dB for JT9.
+
+*Free Text Messages*: Users often add some friendly chit-chat as a
+final transmission, in place of the formatted 73 message.  Free-format
+messages such as TNX JOE 73 GL or 5W VERT 73 GL are supported, up to a
+maximum of 13 characters (including spaces).  It should be obvious
+that JT9 and JT65 are not suitable for extensive conversations or
+rag-chewing.
+
+=== Compound Callsigns
+//This section needs work!!  Must describe and give examples for both 
+//JT65v1 and JT65v2 formats.
+Compound call-signs such as PJ4/K1ABC or G0XYZ/P are handled in a slightly

+=== Pre-QSO Checklist
+
+Before attempting your first QSO with JT9 or JT65, be sure to go
+through the &lt;&lt;X15,Basic Tutorial&gt;&gt; above and the following checklist:
+
+- Your callsign and grid locator set to correct values
+- PTT and CAT control (if used) properly configured and tested
+- Computer clock properly synchronized to UTC within &#177;1 s
+- Radio set to USB (upper sideband) mode
+- Radio's Split mode selected or not, consistent with your choice 
+on *Station* tab of the *Setup | Configuration* window.
+
+IMPORTANT: Remember that JT9 and J65 generally do not require high
+power. Under most propagation conditions, [red]*QRP is the rule!*

-Some rigs work with DTR, RTS, Polling, CAT, and PTT while others do
-not. The number of possible combinations is virtually endless.  The
-intent of this Appendix is to provide configuration information for
-specific rig models, e.g. Icom 756 Pro-III, Kenwood TS-2000, Yaesu
-FT-1000MP, Flex-5000, etc., in order to make installation and
-configuration easier. This is a work-in-progress, and some rigs may
-never be covered.
-
-The table below will link manufacturer names (Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu,
-etc.) to specific models within each brand. If a model is not
-available, please consider drafting a configuration file (a simple
-text file), using the template provided, and submit it to the
-development team for inclusion in future documentation releases.
-

-:rigtemplate: link:rigtemplate.html[Template]
-
-NOTE: If your manufacturer is not listed, it means we do not have
-configuration files for any of the models for that particular
-manufacturer.  Please consider using the Rig Template and submit to

+frequencies higher than about 2700 Hz.  _WSJT-X_ takes care of this by
+using Split mode, receiving with *VFO A* and transmitting with *VFO
+B*.  Under CAT control _WSJT-X_ offsets the Tx dial frequency (*VFO
+B*) in 500 Hz steps, adjusting the generated audio frequency so that
+it always falls in the range 1500 &#8211; 2000 Hz. With *CAT* and *Split Tx*
+enabled on the configuration screen and your transceiver set to *Tx
+Split* mode, this frequency control will be handled automatically.

+however.  On 20m, say, set dial frequency (*VFO A*) to 14.0774 and the
+*JT9 nnnn JT65* dividing line at 1600 Hz.  JT9 signals in their
+conventional sub-band will then appear at 1600 &#8211; 2600 Hz, while JT65
+signals will be below 1000 Hz.  Of course, you might prefer to
+concentrate on one mode at a time, setting your dial frequency to
+(say) 14.076 for JT65 and 14.078 for JT9.  Present conventions have
+the nominal JT9 dial frequency 2 kHz higher than the JT65 dial
+frequency, and the checkbox labeled *+2 kHz*, just below the *Band*
+selector, makes the appropriate settings easy.

+.Open a Wave File:
+
+- Select *File | Open* and navigate to
++...\save\samples\130418_1742.wav+ under your _WSJT-X_ installation
+directory.  When the file opens you should see something similar to
+the to the following screen shot:
+
+[[X12]]
+image::images/r3556-main-ui-80.png[align=&quot;center&quot;,alt=&quot;Main UI and Wide Graph&quot;]
+
+.Decoding Overview
+
+Notice the [green]*GREEN* and [red]*RED* markers on the waterfall
+frequency scale.  Decoding takes place at the end of a receive
+sequence and is organized in two stages.  The first decodes take place
+at the selected Rx frequency, indicated by the green marker.  Results
+appear in both the left (*Band Activity*) and right (*Rx Frequency*)
+text windows on the main screen. The program then finds and decodes
+all signals in the selected mode or modes over the displayed frequency
+range. The red marker indicates your Tx frequency.
+
+At least eight JT9 signals are present in the example file; all
+but one of them are decodable.  When this file was recorded KF4RWA was
+finishing a QSO with K1JT.  Since the green marker was placed at his
+audio frequency, 1224 Hz, his message &#8220;K1JT KF4RWA 73&#8221; appears in both
+decoded text windows.  The *Band Activity* window shows this message
+as well as all the other decodes at nearby frequencies.  The CQ lines
+are highlighted in [green]*GREEN*, and lines containing *My Call*, in
+this case K1JT, are highlighted in [red]*RED*.
+
+TIP: For this step and the next, you may want to pretend you are K1JT by
+entering that callsign temporarily as *My Call* on the &lt;&lt;X11,Configuration
+Screen&gt;&gt;.  Your results should then be identical to those shown in the
+&lt;&lt;X12,screen shot&gt;&gt; above.
+
+[[X13]]
+.Decoding Controls
+
+To gain some feeling for the controls used when making QSOs, try
+clicking with the mouse on the decoded text lines and on the waterfall
+spectral display. You should be able to confirm the following
+behavior:
+
+- Double-click on either of the decoded lines highlighted in
+green. This action should produce the following:
+
+** Callsign and locator of a station calling CQ are copied to the *DX
+Call* and *DX Grid* entry fields.
+
+** Messages for a minimal QSO are generated.
+
+** The *Tx even* box is checked or cleared appropriately, so that you
+will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.
+
+** The Rx and Tx frequency markers are moved to the CQ station&#8217;s
+frequency.
+
+** The *Gen Msg* (&#8220;generated message&#8221;) radio button at bottom right 
+of the main window is selected.
+
+** If you have checked *Double-click on call sets Tx Enable* on the
+*Setup* menu, *Enable Tx* is activated and a transmission starts
+automatically at the appropriate time.
+
+- Double-click on the decoded line with the message &#8220;K1JT N5KDV EM41&#8221;,
+highlighted in [red]*RED*.  Results will be similar to those in the
+previous step, except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is not
+moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from
+a tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it
+was.
+
+- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
+you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.  This behavior
+can also be forced by checking Lock Tx=Rx. 
+
+- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
+sending &#8220;73&#8221; to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
+want to send 73 to him, so the message &#8220;KF4RWA K1JT 73&#8221; is automatically 
+generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
+choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)
+
+- Click on the waterfall to set Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker).
+
+- Ctrl-click on waterfall to set both Rx and Tx frequencies.
+
+- Double-click on the waterfall to set Rx frequency and start a
+narrow-band decode there. Decoded text appears in the right window
+only.  
+
+- Ctrl-double-click sets both Rx and Tx frequencies and decodes at the
+new frequency.
+
+- Click *Erase* to clear the right window. 
+
+- Double-click *Erase* to clear both text windows.

-
-** Messages for a minimal QSO are generated.
-
-** The *Tx even* box is checked or cleared appropriately, so that you
-will transmit in the proper (odd or even) minutes.
-
-** The Rx and Tx frequency markers are moved to the CQ station&#8217;s
-frequency.
-
-** The *Gen Msg* (&#8220;generated message&#8221;) radio button at bottom right

-- Double-click on the decoded line with the message &#8220;K1JT N5KDV EM41&#8221;,
-highlighted in [red]*RED*.  Results will be similar to those in the
-previous step, except the Tx frequency ([red]*RED* marker) is not
-moved.  Such messages are usually in response to your own CQ, or from
-a tail-ender, and you probably want your Tx frequency to stay where it
-was.
-
-- By holding down the Ctrl key when double-clicking on the decoded line 
-you can cause both Tx and Rx frequencies to be moved.  This behavior
-can also be forced by checking Lock Tx=Rx. 
-
-- Double-click on the message from KF4RWA in either window. He is 
-sending &#8220;73&#8221; to K1JT, signifying that the QSO is over.  Most likely you 
-want to send 73 to him, so the message &#8220;KF4RWA K1JT 73&#8221; is automatically 
-generated and selected for your next transmission.  (Alternatively, you might 
-choose to send a free text message or to call CQ again.)
-
-- Click on the waterfall to set Rx frequency ([green]*GREEN* marker).
-
-- Ctrl-click on waterfall to set both Rx and Tx frequencies.
-
-- Double-click on the waterfall to set Rx frequency and start a
-narrow-band decode there. Decoded text appears in the right window
-only.  
-
-- Ctrl-double-click sets both Rx and Tx frequencies and decodes at the
-new frequency.
-
-- Click *Erase* to clear the right window. 
-
-- Double-click *Erase* to clear both text windows.

+
+This sample file contains 17 decodable signals &#8212; nine in JT65 mode
+(flagged with the character # in the decoded text windows), and eight
+in JT9 mode (flagged with @).  Since the Tx mode was set to *Tx JT65*,
+signals in that mode were decoded first.  If you had selected *Tx JT9*,

+
+TIP: Notice the [blue]*BLUE* marker on the waterfall scale, by

+
+These data were recorded with a much narrower Rx bandwidth, roughly
+200 to 2600 Hz. If you have no Rx filter wider than about 2.7 kHz, you
+will be using data like this. For best viewing, adjust *Bins/Pixel*
+and the width of the Wide Graph so that only the active part of the
+spectrum shows, say 0 to 2600 Hz.  Re-open the example file after any
+change of *Bins/Pixel* or Wide Graph width, to refresh the waterfall.
+
+The signals in this file are all JT9 signals.  To decode them in
+JT9+JT65 mode you&#8217;ll need to move the JT65 nnnn JT9 delimiter down to
+1000 Hz or less.
+
+.Start, Zero, and Gain
+Now is a good time to experiment with the *Start*, *Zero*, and
+*Gain* parameters.  *Start* sets the starting frequency at the left
+side of the waterfall scale.  *Zero* sets the baseline level for
+colors, and *Gain* sets the sensitivity for color changes.  For the
+receiver setup of this file good values are *Zero*=0, *Gain*=0.
