Log:
1. Fix a bug that could cause decoder to hang when presented with
bad data.

2. Fix a bug that could allow a Koetter-Vardy false decode instead of
a valid Berlekamp-Massey decode, sometimes leading to program crash.

3. Many more edits in the User's Guide, *.adoc files.

+JT65 was designed for making minimal QSOs via EME (``moon-bounce'') on
+the VHF and UHF bands.  A detailed description of the protocol and its
+implementation in program _WSJT_ was published in {jt65protocol} for
+September-October, 2005.  Briefly stated, JT65 uses 60 s T/R sequences
+and carefully structured messages.  Standard messages are compressed
+so that two callsigns and a grid locator can be transmitted with just
+71 bits.  A 72^nd^ bit serves as a flag to indicate that the message
+consists of arbitrary text (up to 13 characters) instead of callsigns
+and a grid locator.  Special formats allow other information such as
+add-on callsign prefixes (e.g., ZA/K1ABC) or numerical signal reports
+(in dB) to be substituted for the grid locator.  The aim of source
+encoding is to compress the common messages used for minimal QSOs into
+a minimum fixed number of bits.  After compression, a Reed Solomon
+(63,12) error-correcting code converts 72-bit user messages into
+sequences of 63 six-bit channel symbols.
+
+JT65 requires tight synchronization of time and frequency between
+transmitter and receiver.  Each transmission is divided into 126
+contiguous time intervals or symbols, each of length 4096/11025 =
+0.372 s. Within each interval the waveform is a constant-amplitude
+sinusoid at one of 65 pre-defined frequencies.  Frequency steps
+between intervals are accomplished in a phase-continuous manner.  Half
+of the channel symbols are devoted to a pseudo-random synchronizing
+vector interleaved with the encoded information symbols.  The sync
+vector allows calibration of time and frequency offsets between
+transmitter and receiver.  A transmission nominally begins at t = 1 s
+after the start of a UTC minute and finishes at t = 47.8 s.  The
+synchronizing tone is at 11025*472/4096 = 1270.5 Hz, and is normally
+sent in each interval having a &#8220;1&#8221; in the following pseudo-random
+sequence:
+
+ 100110001111110101000101100100011100111101101111000110101011001

+
+Encoded user information is transmitted during the 63 intervals not
+used for the sync tone. Each channel symbol generates a tone at
+frequency 1275.8 + 2.6917 Nm Hz, where N is the value of the six-bit
+symbol, 0 &#8804; N &#8804; 63, and m is 1, 2, or 4 for JT65 sub-modes A, B, or C.
+The signal report &#8220;OOO&#8221; is conveyed by reversing sync and data
+positions in the transmitted sequence.  Shorthand messages dispense
+with the sync vector and use intervals of 1.486 s (16,384 samples) for
+the alternating tones.  The lower frequency is always 1270.5 Hz, the
+same as that of the sync tone, and the frequency separation is 26.92
+nm Hz with n = 2, 3, 4 for the messages RO, RRR, and 73.

-.Transmitting
-
-Immediately before the start of a transmission WSJT-X encodes a
-user&#8217;s message and computes the sequence of tones to be sent.  The
-transmitted audio waveform is computed on-the-fly, using 16-bit
-integer samples at a 48000 Hz rate.  The digital samples are converted
-to an analog waveform in the sound card or equivalent D/A interface.
-
-.Receiving and Decoding
-
-WSJT-X acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a 48000
-Hz rate, and immediately downsamples the stream to 12000 Hz.  Spectra
-from overlapping segments are computed for the waterfall display and
-saved at intervals of 0.188 s, half the JT9 symbol length.  As shown
-in screen shots earlier in this guide, a JT9 signal appears in the
-*Cumulative* spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about 16 Hz wide.
-Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the one at the
-low-frequency edge of a JT65 signal, by convention the nominal
-frequency of a JT9 signal is taken to be that of the lowest tone, at
-the left edge of the spectrum.
-
-At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
-minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
-operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
-twice: first at the selected Rx frequency, and then in the full
-displayed frequency range (or in JT9+JT65 mode, the displayed range
-above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).  Decoding of clean JT9 signals
-in a white-noise background starts to fail below signal-to-noise
-ratio &#8211;25 dB and reaches 50% copy at -26 dB.
-
-Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.
-The blocks are labeled here with the names of functional procedures in
-the code.
-
- sync9:	    Use sync symbols to find candidate JT9 signals 
-            in the specified frequency range
-
-Then, at the frequency of each plausible candidate:
-
- downsam9:  Mix, filter and downsample to 16 complex 
-            samples/symbol
-
- peakdt9:   Using sync symbols, time-align to start of JT9 symbol 
-            sequence
-
- afc9:	    Measure frequency offset and any possible drift
-
- twkfreq:   Remove frequency offset and drift
-
- symspec2:  Compute 8-bin spectra for 69 information-carrying
-            symbols, using the time- and frequency-aligned data;
-            transform to yield 206 single-bit soft symbols
-
- interleave9: Remove single-bit symbol interleaving imposed at the
-	    transmitter
-
- decode9:   Retrieve a 72-bit user message using the sequential
-            Fano algorithm for convolutional codes
-
-
- unpackmsg: Unpack a human-readable message from the 72-bit 
-            compressed format
-
-With marginal or unrecognizable signals the sequential Fano algorithm
-can take exponentially long times.  If the +sync9+ step in the above
-sequence finds many seemingly worthy candidate signals, and if many of
-them turn out to be undecodable, the decoding loop can take a very
-long time.  For this reason the step labeled +decode9+ is programmed
-to &#8220;time out&#8221; and report failure if it is taking too long.  The
-choices *Fast | Normal | Deepest* on the Decode menu provide a
-three-step adjustment of this timeout limit.
