-- With marginal or unrecognizable signals the sequential {shannonfano}
-can take exponentially long times to completion.
-
-- If the first step in the above sequence finds many seemingly worthy
-candidate signals, and if many of them turn out to be undecodable, the
-decoding loop could take a very long time.
-

-- The choice Fast | Normal | Deepest on the Decode menu provides a
-three-step control of this timeout limit.

-- {wsjtx} acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a
-12000 Hz rate.  Spectra from overlapping data segments are computed
-for the waterfall display and saved at intervals of half the JT9
-symbol length.
-
-- As shown in screen shots earlier in this Guide, a *JT9* signal
-appears in the Cumulative spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about
-16 Hz wide.  Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the
-one in *JT65*, by convention the nominal frequency of a *JT9* signal
-is nevertheless taken to be that of the lowest tone at the left edge
-of the spectrum.
-
-- At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
-minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
-operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
-twice:
-
-* first over a narrow range around the selected Rx frequency
-
-* Then in the full displayed frequency range (or in *JT9+JT65* mode, the
-displayed range above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).
-
-- Decoding of clean *JT9* signals in a white-noise background starts
-to fail around signal-to-noise ratio &#8211;25 dB and reached the 50% level
-at -26 dB
-
-- Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.

-.The JT9 Protocol and its Implementation
-
-- *JT9* is a mode designed for making QSOs at HF, MF, and LF.  The
-mode uses essentially the same 72-bit structured messages as *JT65*.
-
-- Error control coding (ECC) uses a strong convolutional code with
-constraint length K=32, rate r=1/2, and a zero tail.  WIth 72-bit
-user messages, this leads to an encoded message length of 
-(72+31) &#215; 2 = 206 bits.
-
-- Modulation is 9-FSK: 8 tone frequencies for data, and one for
-synchronization.  In a given transmission sixteen tone intervals
-(those numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 16, 23, 33, 35, 51, 52, 55, 60, 66, 73,
-83, and 85 in the sequence) are devoted to synchronization.  Thus, a
-transmission requires a total of (206 / 3) + 16 = 85 (rounded up) tone
-intervals.
-
-- Symbol lengths are chosen so that nsps, the number of samples
-per symbol (at 12000 samples per second) is a number with no prime
-factor greater than 7.  This choice makes for efficient FFTs. Tone
-spacing of the 9-FSK modulation is:
-
------  
-df = 1 / tsym = 12000 / nsps, equal to the keying rate
------
-
-- Symbol durations are approximately (TRperiod - 8) / 85, where
-TRperiod is the T/R sequence length in seconds.
-
-
-- The total occupied bandwidth is 9 &#215; df. The generated signal has
-continuous phase and constant amplitude, so there are no key
-clicks. For experimental purposes, submodes of *JT9* were defined with
-transmission lengths greater than one minute.
-
-- Parameters of all submodes are summarized in the following table,
-along with approximate decoding thresholds measured by simulation on
-an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. Numbers following
-*``JT9-''* in the submode names specify the T/R sequence length in
-minutes.  When not otherwise specified in this Guide, *JT9* implies
-submode *JT9-1*, the only submode implemented in current versions of
-{wsjtx}.

+.JT9 Protocol and Implementation
+
+JT9 is a mode designed for making minimal QSOs at LF, MF, and HF.  It
+uses 72-bit structured messages that are nearly identical (at the user
+level) to those in JT65.  Error control coding (ECC) uses a strong
+convolutional code with constraint length K=32, rate r=1/2, and a zero
+tail, leading to an encoded message length of (72+31) &#215; 2 = 206
+information-carrying bits.  Modulation is 9-FSK: eight tones are used
+for data, one for synchronization.  Sixteen symbol intervals are
+devoted to synchronization, so a transmission requires a total of 206
+/ 3 + 16 = 85 (rounded up) channel symbols. The sync symbols are
+those numbered 1, 2, 5, 10, 16, 23, 33, 35, 51, 52, 55, 60, 66, 73,
+83, and 85 in the transmitted sequence. 
+
+Each symbol lasts for 6912 sample intervals at 12000 samples per
+second, or about 0.576 s.  Tone spacing of the 9-FSK modulation is
+12000/6912 = 1.736 Hz, the inverse of the symbol duration.  The total
+occupied bandwidth is therefore 9 &#215; 1.736 = 15.6 Hz.  The generated
+JT9 signal has continuous phase and constant amplitude.  There are no
+key clicks, and the transmitter's power amplifier need not be highly
+linear.
+
+.Transmitting
+
+Immediately before the start of a transmission WSJT-X encodes a
+user&#8217;s message and computes the sequence of tones to be sent.  The
+transmitted audio waveform is computed on-the-fly, using 16-bit
+integer samples at a 48000 Hz rate.  The digital samples are converted
+to an analog waveform in the sound card (or equivalent D/A interface).
+
+.Receiving and Decoding
+
+WSJT-X acquires 16-bit integer samples from the sound card at a 48000
+Hz rate, and immediately downsamples the data stream to 12000 Hz.
+Spectra from overlapping data segments are computed for the waterfall
+display and saved at intervals of 0.188 s, half the JT9 symbol length.
+As shown in screen shots earlier in this guide, a JT9 signal appears
+in the *Cumulative* spectrum as a nearly rectangular shape about 16 Hz
+wide.  Although there is no clearly visible &#8220;sync tone&#8221; like the one
+at the low-frequency edge of a JT65 signal, by convention the nominal
+frequency of a JT9 signal is taken to be that of the lowest tone, at
+the left edge of the spectrum.
+
+At the end of a reception sequence, about 50 seconds into the UTC
+minute, received data samples are forwarded to the decoder.  For
+operator convenience the decoder goes through its full procedure
+twice: first at the selected Rx frequency, and then in the full
+displayed frequency range (or in JT9+JT65 mode, the displayed range
+above the blue *JT65 nnnn JT9* marker).  Decoding of clean JT9 signals
+in a white-noise background starts to fail around signal-to-noise
+ratio &#8211;25 dB and reaches 50% copy at -26 dB.
+
+Each decoding pass can be described as a sequence of discrete blocks.
+For those wishing to study the program&#8217;s algorithms and source code,
+perhaps with an eye toward future improvements, the blocks are labeled
+here with the names of functional procedures in the code.
+
+ sync9:	    Use sync symbols to find candidate JT9 signals 
+            in the specified frequency range
+
+Then, at the frequency of each plausible candidate:
+
+ downsam9:  Mix, filter and downsample to 16 complex 
+            samples/symbol
+
+ peakdt9:   Using sync symbols, time-align to start of JT9 symbol 
+            sequence
+
+ afc9:	    Measure frequency offset and any possible drift
+
+ twkfreq:   Remove frequency offset and drift
+
+ symspec2:  Compute 8-bin spectra for 69 information-carrying
+            symbols, using the time- and frequency-aligned data;
+            transform to yield 206 single-bit soft symbols
+
+ interleave9: Remove single-bit symbol interleaving imposed at the
+	    transmitter
+
+ decode9:   Retrieve a 72-bit user message using the sequential
+            Fano algorithm for convolutional codes
+
+
+ unpackmsg: Unpack a human-readable message from the 72-bit 
+            compressed format
+
+With marginal or unrecognizable signals the sequential Fano algorithm
+can take exponentially long times.  If the first step in the above
+sequence finds many seemingly worthy candidate signals, and if many of
+them turn out to be undecodable, the decoding loop could take a very
+long time.  For this reason the decode9 step is programmed to &#8220;time
+out&#8221; and report failure if it takes too long.  The choices *Fast |
+Normal | Deepest* on the Decode menu provide a three-step adjustment
+of this timeout limit.

+.Rig Specific Configuration
+
+Some rigs work with DTR, RTS, Polling, CAT, and PTT while others do
+not. The number of possible combinations is virtually endless.  The
+intent of this Appendix is to provide configuration information for
+specific rig models, e.g. Icom 756 Pro-III, Kenwood TS-2000, Yaesu
+FT-1000MP, Flex-5000, etc., in order to make installation and
+configuration easier. This is a work-in-progress, and some rigs may
+never be covered.
+
+The table below will link manufacturer names (Icom, Kenwood, Yaesu,
+etc.) to specific models within each brand. If a model is not
+available, please consider drafting a configuration file (a simple
+text file), using the template provided, and submit it to the
+development team for inclusion in future documentation releases.
+
+:yaesu: link:yaesu.html[Yaesu]
+:rigtemplate: link:rigtemplate.html[Template]
